__doc__ = "\nADRT\n===============\n\n``adrt`` is a software package written in ``Python`` for Discrete Random Transform.\n\nExample\n-------\nExamples can be given using either the ``Example`` or ``Examples``\nsections. Sections support any reStructuredText formatting, including\nliteral blocks.\n\n\t$ python example_numpy.py\n\n\nSection breaks are created with two blank lines. Section breaks are also\nimplicitly created anytime a new section starts. Section bodies *may* be\nindented.\n\nNotes\n-----\n\tThis is an example of an indented section. It's like any other section,\n\tbut the body is indented to help it stand out from surrounding text.\n\nIf a section is indented, then a section break is created simply by\nresuming unindented text.\n\n"
