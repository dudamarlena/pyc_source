summary = 'Turn any callable into a powerful command line script through arglist introspection.'
description = 'The marrow.script package is a small library for turning average every-day\ncallables (such as functions and class methods) into command-line scripts\nwhile automatically determining argument naming, typecasting, and generating\nthings like help and version information.  All behavior can be overridden by\nyou, the developer, giving you a flexible and easy to develop with command\nline parsing library to replace ``optparse`` and ``argparse``.  This package\nis not a wrapper around existing parsing libraries, and attempts to match the\nsyntax common to GNU software.\n\nIn a larger scope marrow.script aims to replace other high-level command-line\nscripting libraries such as Paste Script and commandline while also\nimplementing Python 3 compatibility.\n\nFor full documentation, see the README.textile file present in the package,\nor view it online on the GitHub project page:\n\nhttps://github.com/pulp/marrow.script'
