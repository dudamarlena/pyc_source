Lastly,\n      note that preserving a reference to this reference is effectively\n      mandatory for other unrelated reasons: notably, pausing, resuming, and\n      stopping work by calling those methods on the reference to this worker.\n    * If this is a **one-shot worker** (i.e., run only once by a single thread)\n      rather than **recyclable worker** (i.e., run multiple times by multiple\n      threads), the caller should connect the :attr:`signals.finished` signal\n      of this worker to a slot nullifying the aforementioned reference to this\n      worker. Failure to do so will result in a minor memory leak.\n\n    By Qt default, workers are implicitly deleted by their parent\n    :class:`QThreadPool` container immediately on returning from the\n    :meth:`run` method. Although a sensible default for C++-based workers for\n    whom lifecycle management is a non-trivial concern, Python-based workers\n    suffer no such constraints and introduces numerous issues; in particular,\n    allowing Qt to implicitly delete workers on worker completion:\n\n    * Prevents callers from optionally recycling otherwise recyclable workers.\n    * Introduces race conditions between the continued usage of these workers\n      from Python callables from differing threads (e.g., slots, event\n      handlers) and the deletion of these workers by Qt itself from the worker\n      thread. As :class:`QRunnable` instances, workers provide *no* equivalent\n      to the :attr:`QObject.destroyed` signal for deterministically responding\n      to worker deletion. The closest equivalents are:\n\n      * The custom :attr:`signals.finished` signal, which typically (but *not*\n        necessarily) coincides with worker deletion.\n      * The optional Python **finalizer** (i.e., special ``__del__()`` method)\n        and corresponding optional ``callback`` parameter performing similar\n        finalization accepted by the standard :func:`weakref.ref` function,\n        which approximately but *not* exactly coincide with worker deletion and\n        which impose unreasonable constraints on implementation -- notably, the\n        inability to propagate or handle exceptions raised by these callables:\n\n            Exceptions raised by the callback will be noted on the standard\n            error output, but cannot be propagated; they are handled in exactly\n            the same way as exceptions raised from an objectâ€™s ``__del__()``\n            method.\n\n        Exception propagation and logging is central to sane and deterministic\n        application behaviour. Any small benefit gained from handling worker\n        deletion via such a callback would surely be dwarfed by the grosser\n        detriment of being unable to properly handle exceptions.\n\n      In either case, there would exist a slice of time in which Qt has\n      implicitly deleted a worker but Python has yet to be notified of that\n      implicit deletion and hence continue to operate under the inappropriate\n      assumption of that worker\'s continued existence. Race conditions ensue.\n      Technically, these conditions could be obviated by:\n\n      * Explicitly creating weak rather than strong references to workers.\n      * Wrapping each access to such a weak reference in a\n        ``try: ... except ReferenceError: ...`` block handling this race.\n\n      In practice, however, the maintenance burden of doing so substantially\n      exceeds the negligible benefit of permitting Qt to delete workers.\n\n    Thread Affinity\n    ----------\n    All attributes of instances of this class reside in the original thread in\n    which this worker was instantiated *except* the following, which reside in\n    a dedicated thread of a parent :class:`QThreadPool` container and hence are\n    guaranteed to be thread-safe by definition:\n\n    * The :meth:`run` method.\n    * All local objects instantiated by the :meth:`run` method.\n\n    All other attributes should be assumed to *not* be thread-safe. These\n    attributes may nonetheless be rendered thread-safe by either:\n\n    * Locking access to these attributes behind Qt-specific mutual exclusion\n      primitives and context managers (e.g., :class:`QMutexLocker`).\n    * Defining these attributes to be Qt-specific atomic types (e.g.,\n      :class:`QAtomicInt`). Since no Python-based Qt framework (including\n      PySide2) exposes these types, this approach applies *only* to C++-based\n      Qt applications. Ergo, atomic types are currently inapplicable. See below\n      for further details.\n\n    Signal-slot Connections\n    ----------\n    This class subclasses the :class:`QRunnable` interface rather than the\n    standard :class:`QObject` base class. This has various real-world\n    implications. In particular, subclasses of this class *cannot* directly\n    participate in standard queued signal-slot connections and hence should\n    define neither signals nor slots.\n\n    Instead, to emit signals from this worker to slots on objects residing in\n    other threads:\n\n    * Declare a separate :class:`QObject` subclass defining these signals.\n    * Instantiate an instance of this subclass in the parent thread in which\n      this worker is instantiated.\n    * Pass this instance to this worker\'s :meth:`__init__` method.\n\n    By definition, this worker *cannot* receive any signals emitted from any\n    objects residing in other threads as conventional slots. Instead:\n\n    * Define each such slot as a simple method of this subclass. Since this\n      method will be run from the other thread in which the object calling this\n      method resides rather than the pooled thread in which this worker\n      resides, this method\'s body *must* protectively guard access to instance\n      variables via Qt-specific mutual exclusion primitives. While numerous\n      primitives exist, the following maximize thread-safety in common edge\n      cases (e.g., exceptions) and hence are strongly preferred:\n\n      * :class:`QReadLocker` and :class:`QWriteLocker`, context managers\n        suitable for general-purpose use in guarding access to variables\n        safely:\n\n        * Readable from multiple concurrent threads.\n        * Writable from only a single thread at a time.\n\n      * :class:`QMutexLocker`, a context manager suitable for general-purpose\n        use in guarding access to variables safely readable *and* writable from\n        only a single thread at a time.\n\n    Lastly, note that Qt defines numerous atomic types publicly accessible to\n    C++ but *not* Python applications (e.g., :class:`QtCore::QAtomicInt`). In\n    theory, these types could be leveraged as an efficient alternative to the\n    primitives listed above. In practice, these types have yet to be exposed\n    via any Python Qt framework (PyQt5, PySide2, or otherwise) and hence remain\n    a pipe dream at best.\n\n    Versus QtConcurrent\n    ----------\n    The API published by this superclass bears a mildly passing resemblance to\n    the API published by the QtConcurrent framework -- notably, the\n    :class:`PySide2.QtCore.QFuture` class. Unfortunately, the latter imposes\n    extreme constraints *not* imposed by this superclass.\n\n    The QtConcurrent framework only provides a single means of multithreading\n    arbitrary long-running tasks: :func:`PySide2.QtConcurrent.run`. The\n    official documentation publicly admits the uselessness of this function:\n\n        Note that the :class:`PySide2.QtCore.QFuture` returned by\n        :func:`PySide2.QtConcurrent.run` does not support canceling, pausing,\n        or progress reporting. The :class:`PySide2.QtCore.QFuture` returned can\n        only be used to query for the running/finished status and the return\n        value of the function.\n\n    One enterprising StackOverflower `circumvented this constraint`_ by\n    defining a robust C++ :class:`PySide2.QtCore.QFuture` analogue supporting\n    canceling, pausing, and progress reporting. Sadly, this analogue requires\n    C++-specific facilities unavailable under Python, including:\n\n    * **Templating.** Since the :class:`PySide2.QtCore.QFuture` API is\n      templated, all analogues of that API are also necessarily templated.\n    * Private, undocumented Qt APIs (e.g., ``QFutureInterface``,\n      ``QFutureInterfaceBase``).\n\n    Ergo, the QtConcurrent framework is largely inapplicable in Python and\n    certainly inapplicable for multithreading arbitrary long-running tasks.\n\n    .. _circumvented this constraint:\n       https://stackoverflow.com/a/16729619/2809027\n\n    Versus QThread + QObject\n    ----------\n    The API published by this superclass also bears a passing resemblance to\n    various third-party APIs duplicating the common worker-thread Qt model.\n    These models typically:\n\n    * Define one or more application-specific **worker types** (i.e.,\n      :class:`QObject` subclasses performing long-running tasks to be\n      multithreaded).\n    * Instantiate these subclasses as local worker objects.\n    * Instantiate a local :class:`QThread` object.\n    * Move these workers into this thread via the :class:`QObject.moveToThread`\n      method.\n    * Start this thread by calling the :class:`QThread.start` method.\n    * Start, pause, resume, cancel, and restart these workers thread by\n      emitting signals connected to slots defined on these workers.\n\n    As with the aforementioned QtConcurrent framework, this approach\n    fundamentally works in C++ but fails in Python. For unknown reasons, the\n    :class:`QObject.moveToThread` method silently fails to properly move worker\n    objects in entirety from the main thread into the worker thread. Slots\n    defined on workers claim to run from within their worker thread but instead\n    run from within the main thread, as trivially observed with logging.\n\n    Ergo, the worker-thread Qt model is also largely inapplicable in Python and\n    certainly inapplicable for multithreading arbitrary long-running tasks.\n\n    Attributes (Public)\n    ----------\n    signals : QBetseeThreadPoolWorkerSignals\n        Low-level collection of all public signals thread-safely emittable by\n        the :meth:`run` method from within an arbitrary pooled thread possibly\n        running *no* Qt event loop.\n\n    Attributes (Private)\n    ----------\n    _thread : WeakRefType\n        Weak reference to the :class:`QThread` instance wrapping the thread in\n        which the :meth:`run` method is currently running if that method is\n        currently running *or* ``None`` otherwise (i.e., if this worker either\n        has yet to be started *or* has already finished).\n    _worker_id : int\n        0-based integer uniquely identifying this worker. This worker is\n        guaranteed to be the *only* instance of this class assigned this\n        integer for the lifetime of the current process. For disambiguity with\n        the :func:`id` builtin, this variable is *not* named ``_id``.\n\n    Attributes (Private: State)\n    ----------\n    _state : ThreadWorkerState\n        Non-thread-safe current execution state of this worker. This state is\n        non-thread-safe and hence should *only* be accessed by instantiating an\n        exception-safe :class:QMutexLocker` context manager nonce passed the\n        :attr:`_state_lock` primitive as the target of a ``with`` context.\n    _state_lock : QMutex\n        Non-exception-safe mutual exclusion primitive rendering the\n        :meth:`state` property thread-safe. This primitive is\n        non-exception-safe and hence should *never* be accessed directly. Each\n        access to this primitive should be encapsulated by instantiating an\n        exception-safe :class:QMutexLocker` context manager nonce as the\n        target of a ``with`` context. Note that the context provided by the\n        :class:QMutexLocker` class is *not* safely reusable and hence *must* be\n        re-instantiated in each ``with`` context.\n    _state_unpaused : QWaitCondition\n        Thread synchronization primitive, permitting this worker when paused in\n        its parent thread to indefinitely block until an object in another\n        thread (e.g., the main thread) requests this worker be unpaused by\n        waking up this primitive and hence this worker.\n\n    See Also\n    ----------\n    https://martinfitzpatrick.name/article/multithreading-pyqt-applications-with-qthreadpool\n        Prominent blog article entitled "Multithreading PyQt applications with\n        QThreadPool," strongly inspiring this implementation.\n    https://stackoverflow.com/a/34302791/2809027\n        StackOverflow answer strongly inspiring this implementation.\n    '

        This method works in a thread-safe manner safely pausable, resumable,
        and stoppable at any time from any object in any thread by directly
        calling the equally thread-safe :meth:`pause`, :meth:`resume`, and

        States
        ----------
        If this worker is in the :attr:`ThreadWorkerState.IDLE` state, this
        method changes to the :attr:`ThreadWorkerState.RUNNING` state and calls
        the subclass :meth:`_work` method.

        If this worker is in the :attr:`ThreadWorkerState.PAUSED` state, this
        method interprets this signal as a request to resume the work
        presumably previously performed by this worker by a prior signalling of
        this method.  To avoid reentrancy issues, this method changes to the
        :attr:`ThreadWorkerState.RUNNING` state and immediately returns.
        Assuming that a prior call to this method is still executing, that call
        will internally detect this change and resume working as expected.

        If this worker is in the :attr:`ThreadWorkerState.RUNNING` state, this
        method interprets this signal as an accidental attempt by an external
        caller to re-perform the work concurrently being performed by a prior
        call to this method. In that case, this method safely logs a non-fatal
        warning and immediately returns.

        See the :meth:`pause` method for commentary on these design decisions.

        Signals
        ----------
        This method emits the following signals (in order):

        * :attr:`signals.started` immediately *before* this method performs any
          subclass work.
        * :attr:`signals.failed` immediately *after* this method erroneously
          raises an unexpected exception while performing subclass work but
          *before* the :attr:`signals.finished` signal is emitted.
        * :attr:`signals.succeeded` immediately *after* all subclass work
          performed by this method successfully returns but *before* the
          :attr:`signals.finished` signal is emitted.
        * :attr:`signals.finished` immediately *after* this method performs all
          subclass work, regardless of whether that work succeeded or failed.

        Caveats
        ----------
        This method is *not* intended to be called directly. Only the parent
        thread pool of this worker is intended to call this method. External
        callers are advised to call the :func:`guipoolthread.start_worker`
        function instead.

        Subclasses should override the :meth:`_work` method rather than this
        method to perform subclass-specific business logic. This method is

        States
        ----------
        If this worker is in the :attr:`ThreadWorkerState.PAUSED` state,
        this method resumes work by changing this state to
        :attr:`ThreadWorkerState.RUNNING` and waking up the currently blocked
        synchronization primitive if any. The :meth:`_halt_work_if_requested`
        method in the thread running this worker then detects this state change
        and responds by unblocking from this primitive and returning to the
        subclass-specific :meth:`_work` method.

        If this worker is in any other state, this method silently reduces to a
        noop and hence preserves the existing state.

        As a necessary side effect, this pseudo-slot also resumes this worker
        if currently paused *before* halting this worker, thus unblocking the

        Caveats
        ----------
        By :class:`QRunnable` design, this worker is *not* safely restartable
        after halting -- whether by this method being called, the :meth:`_work`
        method either raising an exception or returning successfully without
        doing so, the parent thread running this worker being terminated, or
        otherwise. Ergo, completion is permanent.

        States
        ----------
        Regardless of the current state of this worker, this method halts work
        by changing this state to :attr:`ThreadWorkerState.IDLE`. The
        :meth:`_halt_work_if_requested` method in the thread running this
        worker then detects this state change and responds by raising an
        exception internally caught by the parent :meth:`run` method.
