ADRT
===============

``adrt`` is a software package written in ``Python`` for Discrete Random Transform.

Example
-------
Examples can be given using either the ``Example`` or ``Examples``
sections. Sections support any reStructuredText formatting, including
literal blocks.

        $ python example_numpy.py

Section breaks are created with two blank lines. Section breaks are also
implicitly created anytime a new section starts. Section bodies *may* be
indented.

Notes
-----
        This is an example of an indented section. It's like any other section,
        but the body is indented to help it stand out from surrounding text.

If a section is indented, then a section break is created simply by
resuming unindented text.
