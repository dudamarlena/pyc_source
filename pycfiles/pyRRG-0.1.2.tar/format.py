__doc__ = '\nThe following was taken from the rrd_format.h file in the rrdtool source code.\n\nThe RRD Database Structure\n---------------------------\n\nIn oder to properly describe the database structure lets define a few\nnew words:\n\n ds - Data Source (ds) providing input to the database. A Data Source (ds)\n       can be a traffic counter, a temperature, the number of users logged\n       into a system. The rrd database format can handle the input of\n       several Data Sources (ds) in a singe database.\n\n dst - Data Source Type (dst). The Data Source Type (dst) defines the rules\n       applied to Build Primary Data Points from the input provided by the\n       data sources (ds).\n\n pdp - Primary Data Point (pdp). After the database has accepted the\n       input from the data sources (ds). It starts building Primary\n       Data Points (pdp) from the data. Primary Data Points (pdp)\n       are evenly spaced along the time axis (pdp_step). The values\n       of the Primary Data Points are calculated from the values of\n       the data source (ds) and the exact time these values were\n       provided by the data source (ds).\n\n pdp_st - PDP Start (pdp_st). The moments (pdp_st) in time where\n       these steps occur are defined by the moments where the\n       number of seconds since 1970-jan-1 modulo pdp_step equals\n       zero (pdp_st).\n\n cf -  Consolidation Function (cf). An arbitrary Consolidation Function (cf)\n       (averaging, min, max) is applied to the primary data points (pdp) to\n       calculate the consolidated data point.\n\n cdp - Consolidated Data Point (cdp) is the long term storage format for data\n       in the rrd database. Consolidated Data Points represent one or\n       several primary data points collected along the time axis. The\n       Consolidated Data Points (cdp) are stored in Round Robin Archives\n       (rra).\n\n rra - Round Robin Archive (rra). This is the place where the\n       consolidated data points (cdp) get stored. The data is\n       organized in rows (row) and columns (col). The Round Robin\n       Archive got its name from the method data is stored in\n       there. An RRD database can contain several Round Robin\n       Archives. Each Round Robin Archive can have a different row\n       spacing along the time axis (pdp_cnt) and a different\n       consolidation function (cf) used to build its consolidated\n       data points (cdp).\n\n rra_st - RRA Start (rra_st). The moments (rra_st) in time where\n       Consolidated Data Points (cdp) are added to an rra are\n       defined by the moments where the number of seconds since\n       1970-jan-1 modulo pdp_cnt*pdp_step equals zero (rra_st).\n\n row - Row (row). A row represent all consolidated data points (cdp)\n       in a round robin archive who are of the same age.\n\n col - Column (col). A column (col) represent all consolidated\n       data points (cdp) in a round robin archive (rra) who\n       originated from the same data source (ds).\n\n'
