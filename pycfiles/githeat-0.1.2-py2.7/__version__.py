""" Current version of the githeat application.

This project uses the Semantic Versioning scheme in conjunction with PEP 0440:

    <http://semver.org/>
    <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440>

Major versions introduce significant changes to the API, and backwards 
compatibility is not guaranteed. Minor versions are for new features and other
backwards-compatible changes to the API. Patch versions are for bug fixes and
internal code changes that do not affect the API.

Version 0.x should be considered a development version with an unstable API,
and backwards compatibility is not guaranteed for minor versions.
