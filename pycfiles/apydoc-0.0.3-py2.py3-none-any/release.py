long_description = "\nApydia\n======\n\nApydia is an API reference documentation generator for Python. It's\ndesigned as an instantly serviceable replacement for Pudge's API-documentation\ngenerator. It won't generate complete websites from reST etc. like\nPudge does, though - Apydia is only about the API.\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\n - Basic pudge compatibility and a short and easy migration path\n - Rudimentary Trac-integration, that is links into Trac's sourcecode browser\n - Some fair amount of usability\n - Setuptools integration\n - Flexible, Genshi/XInclude-based themeability with theme inheritance\n - Support for various text formats like Markdown, Textile and reST\n - Other parsers can easily be plugged in on demand\n - Syntax highlighting thanks to Pygments\n"
