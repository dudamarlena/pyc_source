__doc__ = '\n    Apydia - Python API Reference Generator\n    =======================================\n    \n    Apydia is an API reference documentation generator for Python. It\'s\n    designed as an instantly serviceable replacement for Pudge\'s\n    API-documentation generator. It won\'t generate complete websites from\n    reST etc. like Pudge does, though - Apydia is only about the API.\n    \n    Features currently include:\n    ---------------------------\n    \n    - Basic [Pudge](http://pudge.lesscode.org/ "Pudge") compatibility and a short and easy migration path\n    - Rudimentary Trac-integration, that is links into Trac\'s sourcecode browser\n    - Some fair amount of usability\n    - Setuptools integration\n    - Flexible, [Genshi/XInclude](http://genshi.edgewall.org/ "Genshi - Trac")-based themeability with theme inheritance\n    - Support for various text formats like [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/ "Daring Fireball: Markdown"), [Textile](http://www.textism.com/tools/textile/ "Textism: Tools: Textile") and [reST](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/ "Docutils: Documentation Utilities")\n    - Other parsers can easily be plugged in on demand\n    - Syntax highlighting thanks to [Pygments](http://pygments.org/ "Pygments &mdash; Python syntax highlighter")\n    \n    Planned features are:\n    ---------------------\n    \n    - JavaScript-based live search (clientside index, no AJAX)\n    - Maybe a couple more themes\n'
