contributing_template = "\n=======================\nContributing Guidelines\n=======================\n\nThanks for your interest in contributing to this project!  Contributions are\nwelcome and very much appreciated.  If this is your first time contributing to a\nFree and Open Source Software project, consider reading `How to Contribute to\nOpen Source`_ in the Open Source Guides.  Additionally, to maximize the chance\nthat your contribution will be accepted and minimize wasted effort, consider the\nfollowing guidelines:\n\n\nTests Must Pass\n===============\n\nIn order for a pull request to be accepted, it must build and test successfully\non the continuous integration systems.  GitHub displays a build status\nindicator on the pull request.  If the build is broken, please fix it (or add a\ncomment if you think the pull request is not the cause of the breakage).\n\nThe CI build runs several linters and tests.  These can be run locally by\ninvoking ``tox``.  Disabling linter rules using inline configuration is\nacceptable, where justified.  Disable specific rules where possible (i.e.\n``# noqa: F401`` rather than just ``# noqa``).\n\n\nAdd Tests Where Reasonable\n==========================\n\nIf the pull request fixes a bug or adds a feature, consider adding a test to\nensure the bug does not reoccur and the feature works as expected.  If testing\nis not straightforward, feel free to submit the pull request without tests.\nHow to test and whether testing is required can be discussed during the review\nprocess.\n\n\nConsider Discussing Big Changes First\n=====================================\n\nIf the desired change is large, complex, backwards-incompatible, can have\nsignificantly differing implementations, or may not be in scope for this\nproject, opening an issue to discuss the change before writing the code can\navoid frustration and save a lot of time and effort.\n\nThis is not a hard requirement.  If you'd rather start discussing a big change\nwith a proposed implementation, feel free.  Be aware that the code may be\nrejected outright, or require many changes before it is acceptable.\n\n.. _How to Contribute to Open Source: https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/\n"
