"""neat is a `WSGI`_ micro framework that encourages API-centric development of web
applications. The framework is especially compatible with `REST`_ services and
APIs, though it can conceivably be used for more or less anything. Applications
implemented with neat are easy to test and produce data that is easy for clients
to consume.
