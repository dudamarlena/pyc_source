print "\nEggs are managed by setuptools which replaces distutils.\n\nTo 'eggify' your package, build it using this package as a skeleton.\n\nAn egg is a zip compressed Python package that incidentally can be installed\nand imported with regards to Python 2.4 just like normal modules.\n\nIn addition to setup.py, you'll need the ez_setup.py script in your source\ntree.  This script has the ability to install setuptools when needed if not\ninstalled already.\n\nSee NOTES.txt in doc directory for more information.\n"
