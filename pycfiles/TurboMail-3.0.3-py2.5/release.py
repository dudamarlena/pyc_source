long_description = dedent("    TurboMail 3 offers:\n\n    * Simplified creation of complex messages, including rich text, attachments, \n      and more.\n    * Modular delivery managers including the blocking immediate manager and the\n      threaded on demand manager.\n    * Modular back-ends ('transports') including SMTP and in-memory (debug)\n    * Easier debugging when using the debug back-end in concert with the immediate \n      manager.\n    * A plugin architecture with a sample plugin for altered message encoding.\n    * Automatic integration into TurboGears 1.x.\n\n    Python includes several standard packages for handling e-mail. These libraries \n    are independent of each-other, their documentation is hard-to-follow, and their \n    examples are hardly real-world. TurboMail ties these dispersant elements \n    together with an elegant and extensible API, freeing you (the developer) from \n    drudge-work, strained eyes, and loss of hair, even for the most complicated \n    use-cases.\n    ")
