"""ptemplate is a lightweight templating engine for Python, heavily inspired by
Google's `ctemplate <http://google-ctemplate.googlecode.com/>`_ language.
Like ctemplate, ptemplate strongly separates the application's logic and
presentation. At its heart, ptemplate is an extension of Python's advanced
string formatting facility -- it extends the interpreter's built-in formatters
to provide a fast, expressive, content-agnostic templating system.
