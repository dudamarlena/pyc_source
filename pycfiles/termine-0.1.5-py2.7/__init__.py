__long_description__ = 'termine is a commandline tool that makes it easy to connect to\nyour SOAP enabled Groupwise (r) server (using suds) and to fetch your upcoming appointments.\nFor example, to list your appointments for the current week, you would use:\n\n\ttermine list thisweek\n\nand to list your appointments for the current month you would use:\n\n\ttermine list thismonth\n\nSupport for busy searching Groupwise (r) users is present but it is quite rudimentary at the\nmoment. It is expected that this will be much more visible and usable in future versions.'
