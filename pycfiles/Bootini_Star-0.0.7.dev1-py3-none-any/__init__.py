__doc__ = b'\n    Bootils offers process boot-strapping utilities that support writing\n    robust application/service launcher and process life-cycle management scripts.\n\n    It is comprised of a ``bootils`` Python package with building blocks\n    for process and resource management, and a CLI tool named ``nanny`` that\n    watches your child process after starting, until it grows up\n    into a stable running state.\n\n\n    Copyright ©  2015 1&1 Group <jh@web.de>\n\n    Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the "License");\n    you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n    You may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n        http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\n    Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n    distributed under the License is distributed on an "AS IS" BASIS,\n    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n    See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n    limitations under the License.\n'
