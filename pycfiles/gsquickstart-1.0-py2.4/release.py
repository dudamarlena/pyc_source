long_description = '\ngsquickstart is a TurboGears quickstart template plug-in for Genshi templates.\nIt will install a paste template which can be used with TurboGears\' \n``tg-admin quickstart`` command.\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nInstallation with setuptools::\n\n    $easy_install gsquickstart\n\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nCreating a project\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe gsquickstart template is used like any other quickstart template with \ntg-admin quickstart, you just have to specify the template name, which is \n"tggenshi" (for TurboGears Genshi) with the ``-t`` option  template instead \nof the default kid template::\n\n    $tg-admin quickstart -t tggenshi [project name]\n\nThis will install three basic Genshi tempaltes and set up the project \nconfiguration to use Gensi templates as default.\n\n\nUpdating a project\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nFor updating a project with the basic Genshi templates, change into your\nproject directory and run::\n\n    tg-admin update -t tggenshi\n\nSince the "turbogears" template already installs Kid templates in \n``<package>/templates``, they are removed by gsquickstart in a \npost-template-creation step. But when update your project dir, the Kid \ntemplates will be created again. Now gsquickstart can not just delete them \nagain, because they might have been created earlier and on purpose by the \ndeveloper.\n\nWhat the new code does is: if it is an update command, prompt the user, \nif the files ``<package>/templates/{login,master,welcome}.kid`` should \nbe removed (for each file). The default answer is \'n\'. \n\n\nNotice\n------\n\nThe TurboGears 1.0 documentation is written with the default setting of \nKid & SQLObject in mind. The syntax of Genshi templates is very similar \nto that of Kid but there are some differences to bear in mind. \n\nFor example, you need to make some changes to your templates, if you use \nwidgets with Genshi templates: put ``${ET(myform())}`` instead of \n``${myform()}`` as a placeholder for widgets in the template.\n\nYou can find more information in the `TurboGears documentation`_ and on \nthe `Genshi website`_.\n\n.. _TurboGears documentation :http://docs.turbogears.org/1.0/GenshiTemplating\n.. _Genshi website: http://genshi.edgewall.org/wiki/GenshiFaq\n\n\nWhat\'s new?\n-----------\n\n1.0\n---\n\n* The quickstart template was stripped of almost all files shared with the\n  standard "turbogears" template and now inherits from this template instead\n  of from "tgbase". The only files that are added/overwritten by "tggenshi"\n  are ``setup.py``, ``<package>/config/app.cfg`` and the Genshi templates\n  in ``<package>/templates/*.html``. But see the "Updating a project" section\n  above.\n  \n  The new template structure makes it easier to stay synchronized with changes\n  to the standard turbogears template since most files will just be\n  inherited from.\n\n* Synchronized ``app.cfg_tmpl` and `setup.py_tmpl`` with the latest \n  "turbogears" template.\n\n\n1.0Beta2\n--------\n\n* Able to be indexed by turbogears cogbin.\n'
