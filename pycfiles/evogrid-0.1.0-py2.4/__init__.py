"""EvoGrid

Component-based python framework to perform Evolutionary Computation.

Sub-packages overview:

  - ``evogrid.common`` hosts the common implementation of repro

  - ``evogrid.sharing`` hosts components to make it easy to implement sharing with
    ``EvoGrid`` (mainly a comparator adapter)

  - ``evogrid.mo`` hosts components (mainly comparators and adapters) to build
    evolutionary algorithms to solve Multi-Objective Optimization problems.

Each sub-package has a README.txt file and doctests for more details."""
