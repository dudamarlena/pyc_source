long_description = 'tg2exe is a "tg-admin" command line utility extension\n                      which could help you converting the TurboGears project to an\n                      Stand Alone Application on windows platform.\n\n                    Advantage\n                    --------------\n                    The benifit is you can use TurboGears\' power to write \n                    Off-line applications with web interface and AJAX.\n\n                    When the application is running, your computer host as \n                    a web server (Actually it is).\n    \n                    Your user can quickly evaluate your application without install \n                    python or related modules.\n\n                    Install\n                    --------------\n                    You could use::\n\n                        $ easy_install tg2exe\n\n                    command to install this module\n                    \n                    pywin32 is required\n                    http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/\n                    \n                    Usage\n                    ----------\n                    Once you installed tg2exe, you\'ll got an \'makexe\' command within \n                    the "tg-admin" command line utility.\n\n                    Enter your project folder, type::\n\n                      tg-admin makexe\n\n                    and tg2exe will produce a dist folder for you.\n                    \n                    This utility does not make an *.exe, it assembles all the \n                    dependencies and runtime libraries into a single directory,\n                    so that it\'s easy to wrap everything into a single setup package.\n\n                    You are free to package \'dist\' folder into an installer (such as InnoSetup).\n\n                    Notice that the stand alone file are equivalent to production project,\n                    so you need to have a setted prod.cfg. The simple approach is to \n                    rename the sample-prod.cfg to prod.cfg.\n                    \n                    Note\n                    -----------\n                    The owe is its distribution size. The raw dist with quickstart \n                    project is about 12 MB.\n\n                    After a quick remove, 10MB (1/3) is possible.\n\n                    Current Stage: make it work\n                    \n                    (next stages are make it better, then make it small)\n\n                    Credit\n                    ------------\n                    tg2exe is based on the script written by Volodymyr Orlenko,\n                            he post the original script on TurboGears MailList in Jul 2006.\n\n                    If you have any question, please go to google turbogears group.\n                    \n                    History\n                    ------------\n                    0.1 2006/11/14\n                        initial workable\n                    0.2 2006/11/15 \n                        reduce 70% distribution size (30MB->12MB)\n                    \n                '
