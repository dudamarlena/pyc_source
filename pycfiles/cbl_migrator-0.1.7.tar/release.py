__doc__ = 'CBlog is a simple weblog application based on the TurboGears_ framework.\n\nApart from being used by myself as the software that drives my personal blog,\nit is also a useful showcase for various TG programming patterns.\n\nThe software is currently in alpha state, because the data model and the API\n(internal and external, i.e. URls) may still change frequently and some\nfeatures I consider important are still missing. That being said, I already use\nit on a regular basis for my own blog site.\n\n.. _TurboGears: http://turbogears.org\n'
