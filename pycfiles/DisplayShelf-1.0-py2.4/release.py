long_description = 'The Display Shelf renders images in a fancy shelf similar to the iTunes 7 album art display.  One image is in front with a flat perspective, while the other images are slanted to the sides of the selected image.\nThe Display Shelf was written by Ely Greenfield, licensed BSD, and built with the free Flex SDK.  The Display Shelf is compiled to Flash byte code and requires the client to have Flash 9.\n\nYou can find the source code and more information about the Display Shelf at:\nhttp://www.quietlyscheming.com/blog/components/tutorial-displayshelf-component/\n'
