OVERVIEW = make_overview('\nDo not all tutorials start with:\n\n> ### Hello, World!\n\nHow it works:\n\n  * Define a class that is a subclass of `HTMLPage`.\n  * In your class, override the `write_content` method.\n  * Make calls to the `writeln` method which sends output to the\n    client browser.\n\n\nIn the case of this servlet, we have a class named `helloworld` which\nsubclasses `HTMLPage`[^1].  There is only one method, `write_content`\nwhich makes a single call to `writeln` with this text.\n\nThis servlet also sets a single attribute, `title`, which sets the\ntitle of this page.\n\nAfter viewing the python source (click on the link above) you may be\nwondering how the big, centered title got on this page, as well as the\nhorizontal rules and the navigation links, etc.  The import statement\nat the top of the source:\n\n        from TutorialBase import *\n\nemploys some *magic* to hide much of the tutorial machinery.  After\nyou become familiar with WSGIServlets, reading the code in\n[TutorialBase.py](TutorialBase.py) may prove instructive for advanced\nusers.  For now, know that if you cut and paste the code you see when\nviewing the source of each tutorial servlet and replace the import\nline with:\n\n        from wsgiservlets import *\n\nyou would see everything between the top and bottom horizontal rules\nof each page.\n\nIf you view the HTML that is generated by the servlet you will notice\nthat all the content sent to the browser by `write_content` is placed\ninside &lt;BODY&gt;...&lt;/BODY&gt; tags.  How the rest of the HTML is\ngenerated and how you can control it will be shown throughout this\ntutorial.\n\nIn the next example, you will see what happens when you do not\noverride `write_content`.  Click on view source in the next tutorial\nto see what is happening inside the servlet.\n\n[^1]:\n    Which in turn is a subclass of `WSGIServlet`, the abstract base\n    class of all WSGIServlets, instances of which are WSGI\n    applications.  This will be discussed in detail in a later\n    tutorial page.\n\n')
