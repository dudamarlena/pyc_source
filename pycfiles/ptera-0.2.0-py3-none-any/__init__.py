__doc__ = "ptemplate is a lightweight templating engine for Python, heavily inspired by\nGoogle's `ctemplate <http://google-ctemplate.googlecode.com/>`_ language.\nLike ctemplate, ptemplate strongly separates the application's logic and\npresentation. At its heart, ptemplate is an extension of Python's advanced\nstring formatting facility -- it extends the interpreter's built-in formatters\nto provide a fast, expressive, content-agnostic templating system.\n"
