    A :class:`BaseSafelogFilter` uses a compiled regex :attr:`pattern` to
    match particular items of data in log messages which should be sanitised
    (if ``SAFELOGGING`` is enabled in :file:`bridgedb.conf`).

    .. note::
        The :attr:`pattern` is used only for string *matching* purposes, and
        *not* for validation. In other words, a :attr:`pattern` which matches
        email addresses should simply match something which appears to be an
        email address, even though that matching string might not technically
        be a valid email address vis-รก-vis :rfc:`5321`.

    In addition, a ``BaseSafelogFilter`` uses a :attr:`easyFind`, which is
    simply a string or character to search for before running checking against
    the regular expression, to attempt to avoid regexing *everything* which
    passes through the logger.

    :cvar pattern: A compiled regular expression, whose matches will be
        scrubbed from log messages and replaced with :attr:`replacement`.
    :vartype easyFind: str
    :cvar easyFind: A simpler string to search for before to match by regex.
