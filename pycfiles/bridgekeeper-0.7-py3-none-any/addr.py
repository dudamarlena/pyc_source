All other\naddresses are taken to be valid.\n\n\nPrivate IP Address Ranges\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n.. glossary::\n\n   Private Address\n     These address ranges are reserved by IANA for private intranets, and not\n     routable to the Internet::\n         10.0.0.0    - 10.255.255.255  (10.0.0.0/8)\n         172.16.0.0  - 172.31.255.255  (172.16.0.0/12)\n         192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255 (192.168.0.0/16)\n     For additional information, see :rfc:`1918`.\n\n\nReserved and Special Use Addresses\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n.. glossary::\n\n   Unspecified Address\n   Default Route\n     Current network (only valid as source address). See :rfc:`1122`. An\n     **Unspecified Address** in the context of firewalls means "all addresses\n     of the local machine". In a routing context, it is usually termed the\n     **Default Route**, and it means the default route (to "the rest of" the\n     internet). See :rfc:`1700`.\n     For example::\n         0.0.0.0/8\n         ::/128\n\n   Loopback Address\n     Reserved for loopback and IPC on the localhost. See :rfc:`1122`.\n     Example::\n         127.0.0.0\n\n   Localhost Address\n     Loopback IP addresses (refers to self). See :rfc:`5735`.\n     Examples include::\n         127.0.0.1 - 127.255.255.254   (127.0.0.0/8)\n         ::1\n\n   Link-Local Address\n     These are the link-local blocks, used for communication between hosts on\n     a single link. See :rfc:`3927`.\n     Examples::\n         169.254.0.0/16\n         fe80::/64\n\n   Multicast Address\n     Reserved for multicast addresses. See :rfc:`3171`.\n     For example::\n         224.0.0.0 - 239.255.255.255 (224.0.0.0/4)\n\n   Private Address\n     Reserved for private networks. See :rfc:`1918`.\n     Some examples include::\n         10.0.0.0/8\n         172.16.0.0/12\n         192.168.0.0/16\n\n   Reserved Address\n     Reserved (former Class E network). See :rfc:`1700`, :rfc:`3232`, and\n     :rfc:`5735`. The one exception to this rule is the :term:`Limited\n     Broadcast Address`, ``255.255.255.255`` for which packets at the IP\n     layer are not forwarded to the public internet. For example::\n         240.0.0.0 - 255.255.255.255 (240.0.0.0/4)\n\n   Limited Broadcast Address\n     Limited broadcast address (limited to all other nodes on the LAN). See\n     :rfc:`919`. For IPv4, ``255`` in any part of the IP is reserved for\n     broadcast addressing to the local LAN, e.g.::\n         255.255.255.255\n\n\n.. warning:: The :mod:`ipaddr` module (as of version 2.1.10) does not\n             understand the following reserved_ addresses:\n.. _reserved: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5735#page-4\n\n.. glossary::\n\n   Reserved Address (Protocol Assignments)\n     Reserved for IETF protocol assignments.

See :rfc:`2544`.\n     Example::\n         198.18.0.0/15\n\n   Reserved Address (TEST-NET-1)\n     Reserved for use in documentation and example code. It is often used in\n     conjunction with domain names ``example.com`` or ``example.net`` in\n     vendor and protocol documentation. See :rfc:`1166`.\n     For example::\n         192.0.2.0/24\n\n   Reserved Address (TEST-NET-2)\n     TEST-NET-2. See :rfc:`5737`.\n     Example::\n         198.51.100.0/24\n\n   Reserved Address (TEST-NET-3)\n     TEST-NET-3.
