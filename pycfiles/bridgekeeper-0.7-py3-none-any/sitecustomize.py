__doc__ = 'sitecustomize â€• Handles potential loading of extra code when Python starts.\n\n**Module Usage:**\n\nThis is normally (this seems not to work with Twisted, for as-of-yet unknown\nreasons) useful for using :mod:`coverage` to measure code execution in spawned\nsubprocesses in the following way:\n\n 1. Set the environment variable ``COVERAGE_PROCESS_START`` to the absolute\n    path of the coverage config file. If you are in the top-level of the\n    bridgedb repo, do:\n\n        $ export COVERAGE_PROCESS_START="${PWD}/.coveragerc"\n\n 2. In that coverage config file, in the ``[run]`` section, set \n    ``parallel = True``.\n\n 3. Run coverage. From the top-level of the bridgedb repo, try doing:\n\n        $ make reinstall &&             coverage run $(which trial) ./bridgedb/test/test_* &&             coverage combine && coverage report && coverage html\n\nIf ``COVERAGE_PROCESS_START`` is not set, this code does nothing,\n``[run] parallel`` should be set to ``False``, and coverage can be run by\nleaving out the ``coverage combine`` portion of the above command.\n\nTo view the output HTML coverage data, open\n``path/to/bridgedb_repo/doc/coverage_html/index.html`` in a browser.\n'
