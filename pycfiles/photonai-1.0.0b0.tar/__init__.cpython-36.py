PHOTON
A Python-based Hyperparameter Optimization Toolbox for Neural Networks designed to accelerate and simplify the construction, training, and evaluation of machine learning models.

PHOTON is an object-oriented python framework for optimizing machine learning pipelines,
 designed to leave you deciding the important things and automatizing the rest.

PHOTON gives you an easy way of setting up a full stack machine learning pipeline including nested cross-validation and hyperparameter search.
After PHOTON has found the best configuration for your model, it offers a convenient possibility to explore the analyzed hyperparameter space.
It also enables you to persist and load your optimal model, including all preprocessing elements, with only one line of code.
