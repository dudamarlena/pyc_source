    """
    PyEmbeddedImage is primarily intended to be used by code generated
    by img2py as a means of embedding image data in a python module so
    the image can be used at runtime without needing to access the
    image from an image file.  This makes distributing icons and such
    that an application uses simpler since tools like py2exe will
    automatically bundle modules that are imported, and the
    application doesn't have to worry about how to locate the image
    files on the user's filesystem.

    The class can also be used for image data that may be acquired
    from some other source at runtime, such as over the network or
    from a database.  In this case pass False for isBase64 (unless the
    data actually is base64 encoded.)  Any image type that
    wx.ImageFromStream can handle should be okay.
