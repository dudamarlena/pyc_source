What is needed are formatters that\nsupport more flexibility while still providing word wrapping.\n\nThe ParagraphFormatter\n----------------------\n\nThis module provides the **ParagraphFormatter** class. If this class is passed\nto the **argparse.ArgumentParser** creation call as the *formatter_class*\nargument, then help and epilog paragraphs, separated by single blank lines,\nwill be preserved. Word wrapping will be performed within the paragraphs.\n\nNote that **ParagraphFormatter** is implemented by overriding two private\nmethods in the default **argparse** formatter, and that the internals of that\nclass are not considered part of the **argparse** API. There is therefore a\nsmall risk that the code may break with a future standard library release. The\nmodule has been tested across all supported Python 3 versions.\n\n\nThe FlexiFormatter\n------------------\n\nAs it turns out, **ParagraphFormatter** is a more primitive version of a rich\nformatter that has been [long proposed](https://bugs.python.org/issue12806)\nfor inclusion in Python.\n\nThis module provides that **FlexiFormatter** class, with some modifications.\nThis formatter preserves line feeds and indentation, and understands bullet\nlists.\n\nIt would be good for this formatter to be merged - it eliminates the\nAPI-migration risk.\n\nDemo\n----\n\nThe script\n[*demo.py*](https://github.com/davesteele/argparse_formatter/blob/master/demo.py)\ndemonstrates the effect of using the ParagraphFormatter:\n\n    # ./demo.py\n    *************************\n    Using the Default formatter\n    *************************\n    \n    usage: demo.py [-h] [--arg ARG]\n    \n    optional arguments:\n      -h, --help  show this help message and exit\n      --arg ARG   This same feature would be useful for arguments that would\n                  benefit from more explanation. Wouldn't it?\n    \n    This is a multi-paragraph epilog. It is presenting data that would benefit by\n    being visually broken up into pieces. It sure would be nice if it was\n    represented that way.\n    \n    \n    *************************\n    Using the Paragraph formatter\n    *************************\n    \n    usage: demo.py [-h] [--arg ARG]\n    \n    optional arguments:\n      -h, --help  show this help message and exit\n      --arg ARG   This same feature would be useful for arguments that would\n                  benefit from more explanation.\n              \n                  Wouldn't it?\n    \n    This is a multi-paragraph epilog.

It looks nicer 2. It is easier\n                  to read, even if some of the bullets get to be a little long.\n    \n    This is a multi-paragraph epilog. It is presenting data that would benefit by\n    being visually broken up into pieces. It sure would be nice if it was\n    represented that way. 1.
