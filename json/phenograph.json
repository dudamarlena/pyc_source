It works by creating a graph (\"network\") representing phenotypic similarities \nbetween cells and then identifying communities in this graph. \n\nThis implementation is written in Python3 and depends only on `scikit-learn (>= 0.17)` and its dependencies.  \n\nThis software package includes compiled binaries that run community detection based on C++ code written by \nE. Lefebvre and J.-L. Guillaume in 2008 ([\"Louvain method\"](https://sites.google.com/site/findcommunities/)). The code\nhas been altered to interface more efficiently with the Python code here. It should work on reasonably current Linux, \nMac and Windows machines.\n\nTo install PhenoGraph, simply run the setup script:\n\n    pip install PhenoGraph\n\n\nExpected use is within a script or interactive kernel running Python `3.x`. Data are expected to be passed as a `numpy.ndarray`.\nWhen applicable, the code uses CPU multicore parallelism via `multiprocessing`. \n\nTo run basic clustering:\n\n    import phenograph\n    communities, graph, Q = phenograph.cluster(data)\n\nFor a dataset of *N* rows, `communities` will be a length *N* vector of integers specifying a community assignment for each row\nin the data. Any rows assigned `-1` were identified as *outliers* and should not be considered as a member of any community.\n`graph` is a *N* x *N* `scipy.sparse` matrix representing the weighted graph used for community detection. \n`Q` is the modularity score for `communities` as applied to `graph`.\n\nIf you use PhenoGraph in work you publish, please cite our publication:\n\n    @article{Levine_PhenoGraph_2015,\n      doi = {10.1016/j.cell.2015.05.047},\n      url = {http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2015.05.047},\n      year  = {2015},\n      month = {jul},\n      publisher = {Elsevier {BV}},\n      volume = {162},\n      number = {1},\n      pages = {184--197},\n      author = {Jacob H.

This may be more efficient than `kdtree` on very large high-dimensional data sets\n and avoids memory issues that arise in `sklearn`'s implementation.\n * Refactor `parallel_jaccard_kernel` to remove unnecessary use of `ctypes` and `multiprocessing.Array`.\n\n### Version 1.5.1\n\n * Make `louvain_time_limit` a parameter to `phenograph.cluster`.\n\n### Version 1.5\n\n * `phenograph.cluster` can now take as input a square sparse matrix, which will be interpreted as a k-nearest neighbor graph. \n Note that this graph _must_ have uniform degree (i.e. the same value of k at every point).\n * The default `time_limit` for Louvain iterations has been increased to a more generous 2000 seconds (~half hour).\n\n### Version 1.4.1\n\n * After observing inconsistent behavior of sklearn.NearestNeighbors with respect to inclusion of self-neighbors,\n the code now checks that self-neighbors have been included before deleting those entries.\n\n### Version 1.4\n\n * The dependence on IPython and/or ipyparallel has been removed. Instead the native `multiprocessing` package is used.\n * Multiple CPUs are used by default for computation of nearest neighbors and Jaccard graph.\n\n### Version 1.3\n\n * Proper support for Linux.\n\n", "description_content_type": "text/markdown", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/dpeerlab/PhenoGraph.git", "keywords": "", "license": "LICENSE", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "PhenoGraph", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/PhenoGraph/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/PhenoGraph/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "https://github.com/dpeerlab/PhenoGraph.git"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/PhenoGraph/1.5.3/", "requires_dist": ["leidenalg (>=0.7.0)", "setuptools (>=18.0.1)", "numpy (>=1.9.2)", "scipy (>=0.16.0)", "scikit-learn (>=0.17)", "psutil (>4)"], "requires_python": ">=3.6", "summary": "Graph-based clustering for high-dimensional single-cell data", "version": "1.5.3"}, "last_serial": 6764401, "releases": {"1.5.3": [{"comment_text": "", "digests": {"md5": "12890ad0b53218055d11e4064c3266a7", "sha256": "56da594d09385ffa03af42513ce092c4e5ce6b2664a79a5c1b34135c78dc2d86"}, "downloads": -1, "filename": "PhenoGraph-1.5.3-py3-none-any.whl", "has_sig": false, "md5_digest": "12890ad0b53218055d11e4064c3266a7", "packagetype": "bdist_wheel", "python_version": "py3", "requires_python": ">=3.6", "size": 153228, "upload_time": "2020-03-06T19:53:29", "upload_time_iso_8601": "2020-03-06T19:53:29.924944Z", "url": "https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/f4/77/180c44bd3cdcf63d8a25821d8454117df347df3ce4113bf97c2a9f81bd28/PhenoGraph-1.5.3-py3-none-any.whl"}, {"comment_text": "", "digests": {"md5": "d76e7b50c90080a6747811138718abcf", "sha256": "7e7179c4fe4f923285f186e13be0e2deb0b14f8142803d1aea9337b869b778d2"}, "downloads": -1, "filename": "PhenoGraph-1.5.3.tar.gz", "has_sig": false, "md5_digest": "d76e7b50c90080a6747811138718abcf", "packagetype": "sdist", "python_version": "source", "requires_python": ">=3.6", "size": 149940, "upload_time": "2020-03-06T19:53:31", "upload_time_iso_8601": "2020-03-06T19:53:31.900905Z", "url": "https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/2f/d0/3cc4f6aec32d4d5a14cd3bd97f0564eb8402500e2183e41bfc23097e8bf3/PhenoGraph-1.5.3.tar.gz"}]}, "urls": [{"comment_text": "", "digests": {"md5": "12890ad0b53218055d11e4064c3266a7", "sha256": "56da594d09385ffa03af42513ce092c4e5ce6b2664a79a5c1b34135c78dc2d86"}, "downloads": -1, "filename": "PhenoGraph-1.5.3-py3-none-any.whl", "has_sig": false, "md5_digest": "12890ad0b53218055d11e4064c3266a7", "packagetype": "bdist_wheel", "python_version": "py3", "requires_python": ">=3.6", "size": 153228, "upload_time": "2020-03-06T19:53:29", "upload_time_iso_8601": "2020-03-06T19:53:29.924944Z", "url": "https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/f4/77/180c44bd3cdcf63d8a25821d8454117df347df3ce4113bf97c2a9f81bd28/PhenoGraph-1.5.3-py3-none-any.whl"}, {"comment_text": "", "digests": {"md5": "d76e7b50c90080a6747811138718abcf", "sha256": "7e7179c4fe4f923285f186e13be0e2deb0b14f8142803d1aea9337b869b778d2"}, "downloads": -1, "filename": "PhenoGraph-1.5.3.tar.gz", "has_sig": false, "md5_digest": "d76e7b50c90080a6747811138718abcf", "packagetype": "sdist", "python_version": "source", "requires_python": ">=3.6", "size": 149940, "upload_time": "2020-03-06T19:53:31", "upload_time_iso_8601": "2020-03-06T19:53:31.900905Z", "url": "https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/2f/d0/3cc4f6aec32d4d5a14cd3bd97f0564eb8402500e2183e41bfc23097e8bf3/PhenoGraph-1.5.3.tar.gz"}]}
