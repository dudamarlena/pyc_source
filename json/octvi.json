A core feature of the system is the ability to display large amounts of Vegetation Index (VI) imagery, pulled from sources like the MODIS and VIIRS satellite sensors. Obviously, displaying that imagery through our system requires the ability to download it from its source. This is harder than it sounds, especially when we also want to extract specific subdatasets, convert to a different file format, and mosaic dozens of individual \"tiles\" into a single global image.\n\nThis package started out as a local tool for that very purpose. The name \"octvi\" comes from the fact that, at first, I planned to restrict functionality to 8-day (oct) vegetation indices (vi). Over time, though, I realized it was fairly simple to support more imagery products, including 16-day vegetation indices and even DIY multi-day composites. When other researchers in my department started asking to use the package, I realized it needed to be more accessible.\n\n# Features\nThe primary functionality of the `octvi` module is the creation of global mosaics of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) imagery. Supported imagery products include:\n\n* MODIS 8-day NDVI\n  * Terra (MOD09Q1)\n  * Aqua (MYD09Q1)\n* MODIS 16-day NDVI\n  * Terra (MOD13Q1)\n  * Aqua (MYD13Q1)\n* VIIRS 8-day NDVI (VNP09H1)\n* LANCE Near Real-Time\n  * MODIS 8-day Terra (MOD09Q1N)\n  * MODIS 16-day Terra (MOD13Q4N)\n* MODIS 8-day Climate Modeling Grid (CMG)-scale NDVI/GCVI (MOD09CMG; custom compositing)\n  * Note that MOD09CMG supports Green Chlorophyll Vegetation Index (GCVI) as well as NDVI\n\n# Code Example\n\n```python\nimport octvi # import module\n\n# create a list of all days in January 2019 for which there exists valid VNP09H1 imagery\nviirsJanuaryDates = octvi.url.getDates(\"VNP09H1\",\"2019-01\") \n\n# generate global NDVI mosaic of MOD09Q1 data for an 8-day period starting on January 1st, 2019\noctvi.globalVi(\"MOD09Q1\",\"2019-01-01\",\"C:/temp/example_standard.tif\") \n\n# generate custome composite of CMG-scale GCVI for an 8-day period starting on January 1st, 2019\noctvi.globalVi(\"MOD09CMG\",\"2019-01-01\",\"C:/temp/example_cmg.tif\",vi=\"GCVI\") \n```\n\n# How to Use\n\n## In Python\n\nThe `octvi` package contains four submodules: `url`, `extract`, `array`, and `exceptions`. Most of the features you will want, though, are in the top-level module.\n\nThe core functionality is shown in the code example above. Once the package is installed, you can import it in a script or REPL, and then use all the submodules freely. When `octvi` is imported, all submodules are also automatically imported and their namespaces can be accessed as shown with `octvi.url.getDates()` above.\n\n## On the Command Line\n\nThe package comes with one console script entry point: `octvidownload`. This script takes three arguments: product name (e.g. 'MOD09Q1'), date in %Y-%m-%d format (e.g. '2019-01-01') and output directory. Calling the script creates a global NDVI mosaic of the requested product on the requested day. If the product is daily Climate Modeling Grid-scale imagery (e.g. MOD09CMG), the script instead produces its own 8-day composite, with the 'date' argument being the first day of the compositing period.\n\n# License\nMIT License\n\nCopyright (c) 2020 F.
