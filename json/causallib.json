Emphasis on potential outcome prediction  \nCausal effect may be the desired outcome. \nHowever, every effect is defined by two potential (counterfactual) outcomes.  \nWe adopt this two-step approach by separating the effect-estimating step \nfrom the potential-outcome-prediction step.  \nA beneficial consequence to this approach is that it better supports \nmulti-treatment problems where \"effect\" is not well-defined.\n\n##### 2. Stratified average treatment effect\nThe causal inference literature devotes special attention to the population \non which the effect is estimated on.\nFor example, ATE (average treatment effect on the entire sample),\nATT (average treatment effect on the treated), etc.  \nBy allowing out-of-bag estimation, we leave this specification to the user.\nFor example, ATE is achieved by `model.estimate_population_outcome(X, a)`\nand ATT is done by stratifying on the treated: `model.estimate_population_outcome(X.loc[a==1], a.loc[a==1])`\n\n##### 3. Families of causal inference models\nWe distinguish between two types of models:\n* *Weight models*: weight the data to balance between the treatment and control groups, \n   and then estimates the potential outcome by using a weighted average of the observed outcome.  \n   Inverse Probability of Treatment Weighting (IPW or IPTW) is the most known example of such models. \n* *Direct outcome models*: uses the covariates (features) and treatment assignment to build a\n   model that predicts the outcome directly. The model can then be used to predict the outcome\n   under any assignment of treatment values, specifically the potential-outcome under assignment of\n   all controls or all treated.  \n   These models are usually known as *Standardization* models, and it should be noted that, currently,\n   they are the only ones able to generate *individual effect estimation* (otherwise known as CATE).\n\n##### 4. Confounders and DAGs\nOne of the most important steps in causal inference analysis is to have \nproper selection on both dimensions of the data to avoid introducing bias:\n* On rows: thoughtfully choosing the right inclusion\\exclusion criteria \n  for individuals in the data. \n* On columns: thoughtfully choosing what covariates (features) act as confounders \n  and should be included in the analysis.\n\nThis is a place where domain expert knowledge is required and cannot be fully and truly automated\nby algorithms. \nThis package assumes that the data provided to the model fit the criteria.   \nHowever, filtering can be applied in real-time using a scikit-learn pipeline estimator\nthat chains preprocessing steps (that can filter rows and select columns) with a causal model at the end.\n\n\n\n", "description_content_type": "text/markdown", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/IBM/causallib", "keywords": "causal inference effect estimation causality", "license": "Apache License 2.0", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "causallib", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/causallib/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/causallib/", "project_urls": {"Bug Tracker": "https://github.com/IBM/causallib/issues", "Documentation": "https://causallib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/", "Homepage": "https://github.com/IBM/causallib", "Source Code": "https://github.com/IBM/causallib"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/causallib/0.6.0/", "requires_dist": ["pandas (<2,>=0.21)", "scipy (<1.5,>=0.19)", "statsmodels (<1,>=0.8)", "networkx (<3,>=1.1)", "numpy (<2,>=1.13)", "scikit-learn (<1,>=0.20)", "matplotlib (<4,>=2.2)", "seaborn (<1,>=0.8)", "sphinx (==2.1.0) ;
