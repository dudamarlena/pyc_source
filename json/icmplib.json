Some functions are also multithreaded (like the `multiping` function). You can ping the world in seconds!\n- \ud83d\udd29 **Powerful and evolutive:** Easily build your own classes and functions with `ICMPv4` and `ICMPv6` sockets.\n- \ud83d\udd25 **Seamless integration of IPv6:** Use IPv6 the same way you use IPv4. Automatic detection is done without impacting performance.\n- \ud83c\udf08 **Broadcast support** (you must use the `ICMPv4Socket` class to enable it).\n- \ud83c\udf7a **Support of all operating systems.** Tested on Linux, macOS and Windows.\n- \ud83e\udd18 **No dependency:** icmplib is a pure Python implementation of the ICMP protocol. It does not use any external dependencies.\n\n<br>\n\n## Installation\n\nInstall, upgrade and uninstall icmplib with these commands:\n\n```shell\n$ pip3 install icmplib\n$ pip3 install --upgrade icmplib\n$ pip3 uninstall icmplib\n```\n\nicmplib requires Python 3.6 or later.\n\nImport icmplib into your project (only import what you need):\n\n```python\n# For simple use\nfrom icmplib import ping, multiping, traceroute, Host, Hop\n\n# For advanced use (sockets)\nfrom icmplib import ICMPv4Socket, ICMPv6Socket, ICMPRequest, ICMPReply\n\n# Exceptions\nfrom icmplib import ICMPLibError, ICMPSocketError, \\\n    SocketPermissionError, SocketBroadcastError, TimeoutExceeded, \\\n    ICMPError, DestinationUnreachable, TimeExceeded\n```\n\n<br>\n\n## Built-in functions\n\n### Ping\nSend *ICMP ECHO_REQUEST* packets to a network host.\n\n#### Definition\n```python\nping(address, count=4, interval=1, timeout=2, id=PID)\n```\n\n#### Parameters\n- `address`\n\n  The IP address of the gateway or host to which the message should be sent.\n\n  - Type: `str`\n\n- `count`\n\n  The number of ping to perform.\n\n  - Type: `int`\n  - Default: 4\n\n- `interval`\n\n  The interval in seconds between sending each packet.\n\n  - Type: `int` or `float`\n  - Default: 1\n\n- `timeout`\n\n  The maximum waiting time for receiving a reply in seconds.\n\n  - Type: `int` or `float`\n  - Default: 2\n\n- `id`\n\n  The identifier of the request. Used to match the reply with the request.<br>\n  In practice, a unique identifier is used for every ping process.\n\n  - Type: `int`\n  - Default: `PID`\n\n#### Return value\n- `Host` object\n\n  A `Host` object containing statistics about the desired destination:<br>\n  `address`, `min_rtt`, `avg_rtt`, `max_rtt`, `transmitted_packets`,<br>\n  `received_packets`, `packet_loss`, `is_alive`.\n\n#### Exceptions\n- `SocketPermissionError`\n\n  If the permissions are insufficient to create a socket.\n\n#### Example\n```python\n>>> host = ping('1.1.1.1', count=10, interval=0.2)\n\n>>> host.address              # The IP address of the gateway or host that responded\n'1.1.1.1'                     # to the request\n\n>>> host.min_rtt              # The minimum round-trip time\n12.2\n\n>>> host.avg_rtt              # The average round-trip time\n13.2\n\n>>> host.max_rtt              # The maximum round-trip time\n17.6\n\n>>> host.transmitted_packets  # The number of packets transmitted to the destination host\n10\n\n>>> host.received_packets     # The number of packets sent by the remote host and received by\n9                             # the current host\n\n>>> host.packet_loss          # Packet loss occurs when packets fail to reach their destination\n0.1                           # Return a float between 0 and 1 (all packets are lost)\n\n>>> host.is_alive             # Return True if the host is reachable, False otherwise\nTrue\n```\n\n<br>\n\n### Multiping\nSend *ICMP ECHO_REQUEST* packets to multiple network hosts.\n\n#### Definition\n```python\nmultiping(addresses, count=2, interval=1, timeout=2, id=PID, max_threads=10)\n```\n\n#### Parameters\n- `addresses`\n\n  The IP addresses of the gateways or hosts to which messages should be sent.\n\n  - Type: `list of str`\n\n- `count`\n\n  The number of ping to perform per address.\n\n  - Type: `int`\n  - Default: 2\n\n- `interval`\n\n  The interval in seconds between sending each packet.\n\n  - Type: `int` or `float`\n  - Default: 1\n\n- `timeout`\n\n  The maximum waiting time for receiving a reply in seconds.\n\n  - Type: `int` or `float`\n  - Default: 2\n\n- `id`\n\n  The identifier of the requests. This identifier will be incremented by one for each destination.\n\n  - Type: `int`\n  - Default: `PID`\n\n- `max_threads`\n\n  The number of threads allowed to speed up processing.\n\n  - Type: `int`\n  - Default: 10\n\n#### Return value\n- `List of Host`\n\n  A `list of Host` objects containing statistics about the desired destinations:<br>\n  `address`, `min_rtt`, `avg_rtt`, `max_rtt`, `transmitted_packets`,<br>\n  `received_packets`, `packet_loss`, `is_alive`.<br>\n  The list is sorted in the same order as the addresses passed in parameters.\n\n#### Exceptions\n- `SocketPermissionError`\n\n  If the permissions are insufficient to create a socket.\n\n#### Example\n```python\n>>> hosts = multiping(['10.0.0.5', '127.0.0.1', '::1'])\n\n>>> for host in hosts:\n...     if host.is_alive:\n...         # See the Host class for details\n...         print(f'{host.address} is alive!')\n...\n...     else:\n...         print(f'{host.address} is dead!')\n...\n\n# 10.0.0.5 is dead!\n# 127.0.0.1 is alive!\n# ::1 is alive!\n```\n\n<br>\n\n### Traceroute\nDetermine the route to a destination host.\n\nThe Internet is a large and complex aggregation of network hardware, connected together by gateways. Tracking the route one's packets follow can be difficult. This function utilizes the IP protocol time to live field and attempts to elicit an *ICMP TIME_EXCEEDED* response from each gateway along the path to some host.\n\n#### Definition\n```python\ntraceroute(address, count=3, interval=0.05, timeout=2, id=PID, max_hops=30, fast_mode=False)\n```\n\n#### Parameters\n- `address`\n\n  The destination IP address.\n\n  - Type: `str`\n\n- `count`\n\n  The number of ping to perform per hop.\n\n  - Type: `int`\n  - Default: 3\n\n- `interval`\n\n  The interval in seconds between sending each packet.\n\n  - Type: `int` or `float`\n  - Default: 0.05\n\n- `timeout`\n\n  The maximum waiting time for receiving a reply in seconds.\n\n  - Type: `int` or `float`\n  - Default: 2\n\n- `id`\n\n  The identifier of the request. Used to match the reply with the request.<br>\n  In practice, a unique identifier is used for every ping process.\n\n  - Type: `int`\n  - Default: `PID`\n\n- `max_hops`\n\n  The maximum time to live (max number of hops) used in outgoing probe packets.\n\n  - Type: `int`\n  - Default: 30\n\n- `fast_mode`\n\n  When this option is enabled and an intermediate router has been reached, skip to the next hop rather than perform additional requests. The `count` option then becomes the maximum number of requests in case of no responses.\n\n  - Type: `bool`\n  - Default: False\n\n#### Return value\n- `List of Hop`\n\n  A `list of Hop` objects representing the route to the desired host. A `Hop` is a `Host` object with an additional attribute: a `distance`. The list is sorted in ascending order according to the distance (in terms of hops) that separates the remote host from the current machine.\n\n#### Exceptions\n- `SocketPermissionError`\n\n  If the permissions are insufficient to create a socket.\n\n#### Example\n```python\n>>> hops = traceroute('1.1.1.1')\n\n>>> print('Distance (ttl)    Address    Average round-trip time')\n>>> last_distance = 0\n\n>>> for hop in hops:\n...     if last_distance + 1 != hop.distance:\n...         print('*** Some routers does not respond')\n...\n...     # See the Hop class for details\n...     print(f'{hop.distance}    {hop.address}    {hop.avg_rtt} ms')\n...\n...     last_distance = hop.distance\n...\n\n# Distance (ttl)    Address                 Average round-trip time\n# 1                 10.0.0.1                5.19 ms\n# 2                 194.149.169.49          7.55 ms\n# 3                 194.149.166.54          12.2 ms\n# ***               Some routers does not respond\n# 5                 212.73.205.22           22.1 ms\n# 6                 1.1.1.1                 13.5 ms\n```\n\n<br>\n\n## ICMP sockets\n\nIf you want to create your own functions and classes using the ICMP protocol, you can use the `ICMPv4Socket` (for IPv4) and the `ICMPv6Socket` (for IPv6 only). These classes have many methods and attributes in common. They manipulate `ICMPRequest` and `ICMPReply` objects.\n\n```\n                                      \u250c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2510\n    \u250c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2510   send(...)   \u2502 ICMPSocket:     \u2502   receive()   \u250c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2510\n    \u2502   ICMPRequest   \u2502 \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500> \u2502 ICMPv4Socket or \u2502 \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500> \u2502    ICMPReply    \u2502\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518               \u2502 ICMPv6Socket    \u2502               \u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518\n                                      \u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518\n```\n\n### ICMPRequest\nA user-created class that represents an *ICMP ECHO_REQUEST*.\n\n#### Definition\n```python\nICMPRequest(destination, id, sequence, payload_size=56, timeout=2, ttl=64)\n```\n\n#### Parameters / Getters\n- `destination`\n\n  The IP address of the gateway or host to which the message should be sent.\n\n  - Type: `str`\n\n- `id`\n\n  The identifier of the request.
