After installing the\nmodule, users can obtain the \"Advisor\" right for the \"Accounting & Finance\"\napplication. This feature was included in Odoo version 9 and was removed from the\nCommunity Edition with version 10.\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nTo install this module, you need to:\n\nDownload the module and add it to your Odoo addons folder. Afterward, log on to\nyour Odoo server and go to the Apps menu. Trigger the debug mode and update the\nlist by clicking on the \"Update Apps List\" link. Now install the module by\nclicking on the install button.\n\nAnother way to install this module is via the package management for Python\n(`PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/pip/>`_).\n\nTo install our modules using the package manager make sure\n`odoo-autodiscover <https://pypi.org/project/odoo-autodiscover/>`_ is installed\ncorrectly. Then open a console and install the module by entering the following\ncommand:\n\n``pip install --extra-index-url https://nexus.mukit.at/repository/odoo/simple <module>``\n\nThe module name consists of the Odoo version and the module name, where\nunderscores are replaced by a dash.\n\n**Module:** \n\n``odoo<version>-addon-<module_name>``\n\n**Example:**\n\n``sudo -H pip3 install --extra-index-url https://nexus.mukit.at/repository/odoo/simple odoo11-addon-muk-utils``\n\nOnce the installation has been successfully completed, the app is already in the\ncorrect folder. Log on to your Odoo server and go to the Apps menu. Trigger the \ndebug mode and update the list by clicking on the \"Update Apps List\" link. Now\ninstall the module by clicking on the install button.\n\nThe biggest advantage of this variant is that you can now also update the app\nusing the \"pip\" command. To do this, enter the following command in your console:\n\n``pip install --upgrade --extra-index-url https://nexus.mukit.at/repository/odoo/simple <module>``\n\nWhen the process is finished, restart your server and update the application in \nOdoo. The steps are the same as for the installation only the button has changed\nfrom \"Install\" to \"Upgrade\".\n\nYou can also view available Apps directly in our `repository <https://nexus.mukit.at/#browse/browse:odoo>`_\nand find a more detailed installation guide on our `website <https://mukit.at/page/open-source>`_.\n\nFor modules licensed under OPL-1, you will receive access data when you purchase\nthe module. If the modules were not purchased directly from\n`MuK IT <https://www.mukit.at/>`_ please contact our support (support@mukit.at)\nwith a confirmation of purchase to receive the corresponding access data.\n\nUpgrade\n============\n\nTo upgrade this module, you need to:\n\nDownload the module and add it to your Odoo addons folder. Restart the server\nand log on to your Odoo server. Select the Apps menu and upgrade the module by\nclicking on the upgrade button.\n\nIf you installed the module using the \"pip\" command, you can also update the\nmodule in the same way. Just type the following command into the console:\n\n``pip install --upgrade --extra-index-url https://nexus.mukit.at/repository/odoo/simple <module>``\n\nWhen the process is finished, restart your server and update the application in \nOdoo, just like you would normally.\n\nConfiguration\n=============\n\nNo additional configuration is needed to use this module.\n\nUsage\n=============\n\nTo activate the accounting dashboard and its features:\n\n#. Go to *Settings -> Users*.\n#. Click on a user to open the form view.\n#. In edit mode, open the *Accounting & Finance* selection.\n#. Select the now available *Advisor* group.\n\nCredits\n=======\n\nContributors\n------------\n\n* Mathias Markl <mathias.markl@mukit.at>\n\nImages\n------------\n\nSome pictures are based on or inspired by the icon set of Font Awesome:\n\n* `Font Awesome <https://fontawesome.com>`_\n\nProjects\n------------\n\nParts of the module are inspired by:\n\n* `Odoo <https://github.com/odoo/odoo>`_\n\nAuthor & Maintainer\n-------------------\n\nThis module is maintained by the `MuK IT GmbH <https://www.mukit.at/>`_.\n\nMuK IT is an Austrian company specialized in customizing and extending Odoo.\nWe develop custom solutions for your individual needs to help you focus on\nyour strength and expertise to grow your business.\n\nIf you want to get in touch please contact us via mail\n(sale@mukit.at) or visit our website (https://mukit.at).\n\n", "description_content_type": "", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://www.mukit.at", "keywords": "", "license": "LGPL-3", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "odoo12-addon-muk-account-accountant", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/odoo12-addon-muk-account-accountant/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/odoo12-addon-muk-account-accountant/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "https://www.mukit.at"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/odoo12-addon-muk-account-accountant/12.0.2.0.0/", "requires_dist": ["odoo12-addon-muk-web-utils", "odoo (<12.1dev,>=12.0a)"], "requires_python": ">=3.5", "summary": "Financial and Analytic Accounting", "version": "12.0.2.0.0"}, "last_serial": 5526629, "releases": {"12.0.1.0.5": [{"comment_text": "", "digests": {"md5": "8271e231c6786ac4314dc24ba6e923db", "sha256": "72ab037896f43439123fc2b24acd5ff4da683749f909b784596a71a680b3ed2d"}, "downloads": -1, "filename": "odoo12_addon_muk_account_accountant-12.0.1.0.5-py2.py3-none-any.whl", "has_sig": false, "md5_digest": "8271e231c6786ac4314dc24ba6e923db", "packagetype": "bdist_wheel", "python_version": "py2.py3", "requires_python": ">=3.5", "size": 498215, "upload_time": "2019-04-10T10:47:17", "upload_time_iso_8601": "2019-04-10T10:47:17.218597Z", "url": "https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/31/db/2137d6145b9b08a7c40f231505bbb3e8dfbb358e9a58667b0f283121cc0e/odoo12_addon_muk_account_accountant-12.0.1.0.5-py2.py3-none-any.whl"}], "12.0.2.0.0": [{"comment_text": "", "digests": {"md5": "d9974fe802731c99203d1aa2d0540770", "sha256": "cb7306317c809b9ff0538146ce6dd81b640ac03d3ac31bb1aaa65531b612f41e"}, "downloads": -1, "filename": "odoo12_addon_muk_account_accountant-12.0.2.0.0-py2.py3-none-any.whl", "has_sig": false, "md5_digest": "d9974fe802731c99203d1aa2d0540770", "packagetype": "bdist_wheel", "python_version": "py2.py3", "requires_python": ">=3.5", "size": 490227, "upload_time": "2019-07-13T10:50:53", "upload_time_iso_8601": "2019-07-13T10:50:53.830271Z", "url": "https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/23/68/4f2f7c4118d67b737d9ed79b243d0700dbba97634131f353c07c69ba8060/odoo12_addon_muk_account_accountant-12.0.2.0.0-py2.py3-none-any.whl"}]}, "urls": [{"comment_text": "", "digests": {"md5": "d9974fe802731c99203d1aa2d0540770", "sha256": "cb7306317c809b9ff0538146ce6dd81b640ac03d3ac31bb1aaa65531b612f41e"}, "downloads": -1, "filename": "odoo12_addon_muk_account_accountant-12.0.2.0.0-py2.py3-none-any.whl", "has_sig": false, "md5_digest": "d9974fe802731c99203d1aa2d0540770", "packagetype": "bdist_wheel", "python_version": "py2.py3", "requires_python": ">=3.5", "size": 490227, "upload_time": "2019-07-13T10:50:53", "upload_time_iso_8601": "2019-07-13T10:50:53.830271Z", "url": "https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/23/68/4f2f7c4118d67b737d9ed79b243d0700dbba97634131f353c07c69ba8060/odoo12_addon_muk_account_accountant-12.0.2.0.0-py2.py3-none-any.whl"}]}
