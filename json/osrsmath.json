Built upon this are some applications that attempt to optimize game play or otherwise apply these equations. Having these models in a powerful programming language like Python allows novel problems to be solved. The applications are currently unpolished and not very user friendly, but here is a list of apps:\n\n\n| Application        | File           | Description  |\n| ------------- |:-------------:| :-----|\n| Path | `apps/path.py` | For a given set of equipment: What is the most efficient way to train from a given attack and strength level to a desired level in nmz?|\n| Optimize | `apps/optimize.py` | Use a genetic algorithm to find a near optimal equipment setup and/or opponent(s) for maximum experience rates. (In progress)|\n| Nightmare Zone (nmz)| `apps/nmz.py` |How much experience per hour should you expect from various setups?|\n| Single Opponent | `apps/single_opponent.py` | Straight forward combat analysis versus a single opponent.|\n\nAt this point in time, they don't currently provide interfaces, so you would have to edit the files, then run those scripts to use them. This will change in the future.\n\n## Installing\n\nTo get the code, simply run\n``` pip install osrsmath ```\n\n\nTo check that everything is working, in the command line run\n```\npython -m osrsmath.apps.path\n```\nIf your environment supports graphical displays, you should get an image like:\n![Image of Training Scheme](Results/training_schemes/recur_60_60.png)\notherwise you should at least get the saved image in the current directory.\n\n\nAlternatively, since at the moment there is not interface to access the apps, you may wish instead to download the code files, run the setup script, and explore from there:\n```\n\tgit clone https://github.com/Palfore/OSRS-Combat\n\tcd OSRS-Combat/osrsmath\n\tpython setup.py -e .\n```\nThen edit `/apps/path.py` (for example), and run `python /apps/path.py`.\n\n## Running the tests\n\nComing soon!\n\n## Built With\n\n* [osrsbox](https://pypi.org/project/osrsbox/) - Provides Data files\n* [dijkstar](https://pypi.org/project/Dijkstar/) - Implements the dijkstra Algorithm\n\n## Authors\n\n* **Nawar Ismail** - *Initial work* - [Palfore](https://github.com/Palfore)\n\n<!-- See also the list of [contributors](https://github.com/your/project/contributors) who participated in this project. -->\n\n## License\n\nThis project is licensed under the MIT License -
