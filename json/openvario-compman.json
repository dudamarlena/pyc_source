It runs on\n[OpenVario](https://openvario.org/) flight computer and automatically downloads\ncurrent contest airspace and waypoint files when they are published on Soaring\nSpot. `compman` also configures [XCSoar](https://xcsoar.org/) to use the\nupdated files. You can switch between contests easily without need to download\nand transfer files to the flight computer manually.\n\nIt is a text-mode application, which might look primitive for modern\ngraphics-rich UI standards. However, it is written using contemporary software\nengineering techniques, responsive, very fast and easy to use, even with very\nlimited input controls available for OpenVario. It also has a fairly simple\ncode, that makes `openvario` easy to understand and change.\n\n[![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/307125.svg)](https://asciinema.org/a/307125)\n\n## Usage\n\nThis app requires Internet connection to be useful. The simplest way to get it\non your OpenVerio is to use a small USB WiFi dongle.\n\nTypically, during the gliding competition, you run `compman` daily to check if\nnew competition files were uploaded to Soaring Spot (or when new files are\nannounced during the briefing). When `compman` is started, new files for the\ncurrent competition will be automatically downloaded to the device. As soon as\nyou select them, XCSoar will be reconfigured to use these files. Simply exit\n`compman` and run the XCSoar the usual way.\n\nWhen you go to the next competition, simply switch the contest using `compman`\nmenu system. All competition files will be automatically downloaded and XCSoar\nwill be reconfigured. No more complicated downloading of files on the flash\ndrives and transferring them manually to the OpenVario!\n\n`compman` can be operated using only 6 buttons: 4 arrow keys for navigating,\n<kbd>Enter</kbd> (usually a push on rotary encoder or joystick) for selecting\nitems and <kbd>Esc</kbd> (usually marked as <kbd>X</kbd>) for going back.\n\n## Installation\n\nTo install `compman` on your OpenVario you will also need to be able to ssh to\nthe device or connect to it through standard debugging serial port. Assuming\nthe network connection is up, use `opkg` package manager to download and\ninstall `compman`:\n\n```\n$ echo src compman http://openvario.lebedev.lt/opkg/armv7vet2hf-neon/ >> /etc/opkg/customfeeds.conf\n$ opkg update\n$ opkg install openvario-compman\n$ opkg install ovmenu-compman\n```\n\nAt this point you should be able to run compman from command line:\n\n```\n$ compman\n```\n\nReboot your OpenVario and you should also see the new menu item for `compman`!\n\n## Developing\n\nIt is not required to own or have access to OpenVario device in order to\ndevelop `compman`. The only requirements are Python 3.7 or higher and terminal\nemulator, readily available on MacOS or Linux operating systems. There are lots\nof free options for Windows as well.\n\n### Setting up the development environment\n\n`compman` uses `pipenv` for managing dependencies and dev environment. If you\ndon't have it yet, install with:\n\n```sh\n$ pip install pipenv\n```\n\nAfter checking out the sources, `cd` to `openvario-compman` directory and run:\n\n```sh\n$ pipenv shell\n$ pipenv install\n```\n\nAfter that, your development environment is ready, you should be able to run\nthe app:\n\n```sh\n$ compman\n```\n\nIt is possible to adjust few options by providing them in `.env` file, located\nin project directory. You can copy the sample file `sample.env` to `.env` and\nadjust values there.\n\n### Development tools\n\n`compman` uses various tools to check the code quality. They are generally\navailable through `make` program. Most useful are these:\n\n* `make test` - runs the test suite\n* `make mypy` - checks the sources with static type checker\n* `make black` - reformats the source code to match the code style\n\nIt is often useful to watch the log file while running `compman` in development\nenvironment. The log file will contain traces of actions user makes and\ntracebacks from exceptions happening during the execution. Use `tail` to watch\nthe logs in a separate terminal window:\n\n```sh\n$ tail -F ~/.compman/compman.log\n```\n\n### Filesystem\n\n`compman` keeps all its files under `~/.compman` directory. It contains the set\nof directories for each configured competition. Each competition directory\ncontains downloaded airspace and waypoints files. This directory can be changed\nby stting `COMPMAN_DATADIR` environment variable or using `--datadir`\ncommand-line option.\n\n`compman` expects to find XCSoar profile in `~/.xcsoar` directory.", "description_content_type": "text/markdown", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/kedder/openvario-compman", "keywords": "openvario tui competition igc xcsoar", "license": "", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "openvario-compman", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/openvario-compman/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/openvario-compman/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "https://github.com/kedder/openvario-compman"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/openvario-compman/0.3/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": ">=3.7, <4", "summary": "Competition Manager for OpenVario", "version": "0.3"}, "last_serial": 6945813, "releases": {"0.1": [{"comment_text": "", "digests": {"md5": "a4b99116f0565da956c09657fd600772", "sha256": "0356e4d358353216f6699676b9c34dbea028c76fafe0508a02736a413cdb75c6"}, "downloads": -1, "filename": "openvario-compman-0.1.tar.gz", "has_sig": false, "md5_digest": "a4b99116f0565da956c09657fd600772", "packagetype": "sdist", "python_version": "source", "requires_python": ">=3.6, <4", "size": 28114, "upload_time": "2020-03-05T20:52:57", "upload_time_iso_8601": "2020-03-05T20:52:57.827053Z", "url": "https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/ea/8b/5cff7847e2e05a64652d5c3b072a202ec4a60a3684ce50774c70b0e07544/openvario-compman-0.1.tar.gz"}], "0.2": [{"comment_text": "", "digests": {"md5": "65a443dcdbcf499f14fe688f43aec894", "sha256": "c33f55d903a07fc0e577adef48219102c178b479846206e18d30ff839ad3d1bc"}, "downloads": -1, "filename": "openvario-compman-0.2.tar.gz", "has_sig": false, "md5_digest": "65a443dcdbcf499f14fe688f43aec894", "packagetype": "sdist", "python_version": "source", "requires_python": ">=3.7, <4", "size": 28131, "upload_time": "2020-03-10T16:59:24", "upload_time_iso_8601": "2020-03-10T16:59:24.370845Z", "url": "https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/77/f7/b17bdc3069414061885ffda2f69631a03b92eb4176d2960aef4223d7d23a/openvario-compman-0.2.tar.gz"}], "0.3": [{"comment_text": "", "digests": {"md5": "b2cc8f3f1aa1b142fcc22871ba4821f7", "sha256": "ef99aa9f7110caa9354f649a7f4a0749aed775fac769d3b92b095c57d26528d7"}, "downloads": -1, "filename": "openvario-compman-0.3.tar.gz", "has_sig": false, "md5_digest": "b2cc8f3f1aa1b142fcc22871ba4821f7", "packagetype": "sdist", "python_version": "source", "requires_python": ">=3.7, <4", "size": 32435, "upload_time": "2020-04-03T20:06:38", "upload_time_iso_8601": "2020-04-03T20:06:38.077073Z", "url": "https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/af/6b/c9074d534991b63670ad75f78f205a2853125937139d015f10082cffd9a3/openvario-compman-0.3.tar.gz"}]}, "urls": [{"comment_text": "", "digests": {"md5": "b2cc8f3f1aa1b142fcc22871ba4821f7", "sha256": "ef99aa9f7110caa9354f649a7f4a0749aed775fac769d3b92b095c57d26528d7"}, "downloads": -1, "filename": "openvario-compman-0.3.tar.gz", "has_sig": false, "md5_digest": "b2cc8f3f1aa1b142fcc22871ba4821f7", "packagetype": "sdist", "python_version": "source", "requires_python": ">=3.7, <4", "size": 32435, "upload_time": "2020-04-03T20:06:38", "upload_time_iso_8601": "2020-04-03T20:06:38.077073Z", "url": "https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/af/6b/c9074d534991b63670ad75f78f205a2853125937139d015f10082cffd9a3/openvario-compman-0.3.tar.gz"}]}
