Through these means flair allows the game's state to be inspected in real-time. It also allows the game client to be augmented, for example adding clipboard access to the game's chat box or implementing a custom command line interface.\n\n### Installation\nflair is on PyPI:\n\n```\npython -m pip install fl-flair\n```\n\nAlternatively you can install straight from this repository:\n\n```sh\npython -m pip install https://github.com/biqqles/flair/archive/master.zip\n```\n\nBuilt wheels are also available under [Releases](https://github.com/biqqles/flair/releases), as is a changelog. flair requires Python 3.6 or higher.\n\n### Basic usage\nflair must be run with administrator privileges. This is required for it to be able to hook keyboard input in Freelancer.\n\nflair includes a testing mode. To access it run `python -m flair <path_to_freelancer>`. In this mode flair will load all built-in augmentations, print all events, and begin polling and printing the state of the game to the terminal. More on all of those later.\n\nTo use flair in your own programs, simply create an instance of `flair.FreelancerState`. This will begin polling the game (by default every 1 second). The polling frequency only affects when events are emitted - in most cases accesses to FreelancerState will cause the immediate state of the game to be read.\n\nBasic usage of flair relies on two main principles:\n\n - a state object, which allows access to the game's state in real time\n - a simple events system inspired by Qt's signals and slots mechanism\n\nThe API for the hook itself is also of course available for cases not covered by the builtin `FreelancerState`, like creating [augmentations](#augmentations).\n\nAll these concepts are discussed in detail below.\n\n## API\n### FreelancerState\nAs mentioned earlier, simply create an instance of `flair.FreelancerState` to get access to the game state. Its constructor takes one argument, the path to the game's folder. This object has the following methods and properties:\n\n|Methods             |Type             |Notes                                                                                    |\n|:-------------------|:----------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|`begin_polling(period)`|              |Begin polling the game's state and emitting events.

For example `flair.events.message_sent.connect(lambda message: print(message))` causes that lambda to be called every time flair emits the `message_sent` signal, thereby printing the contents of the message to the terminal.\n\n|Event                       |Emitted when                       | Parameter(s)                                                  |\n|:---------------------------|:----------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------|\n|**`character_changed`**     |New character loaded               |`name`=new character name                                      |\n|**`account_changed`**       |Active (registry) account changed  |`account`=new account code                                     |\n|**`system_changed`**        |New system entered                 |`system`=New system display name                               |\n|**`docked`**                |Docked base (respawn point) changed|`base`=new base display name                                   |\n|**`undocked`**              |Undocked from base                 |N/A                                                            |\n|**`credits_changed`**       |Credit balance changed             |`balance`=new credit balance                                   |\n|**`message_sent`**          |New message sent by player         |`message`=message text                                         |\n|**`chat_box_opened`**       |Chat box opened                    |`message`=message text                                         |\n|**`chat_box_closed`**       |Chat box closed                    |`message_sent`=whether message sent                            |\n|**`freelancer_started`**    |Freelancer process launched        |N/A                                                            |\n|**`freelancer_stopped`**    |Freelancer process closed          |N/A                                                            |\n|**`switched_to_foreground`**|Freelancer switched to foreground  |N/A                                                            |\n|**`switched_to_background`**|Freelancer switched to background  |N/A                                                            |\n\nSource: [flair/inspect/events.py](flair/inspect/events.py)\n\n### Hook\n[`flair/hook`](flair/hook) contains the lower-level code for hooking into the game. You will likely only need to use this directly if you wish to go beyond simply using `FreelancerState` and the events system. It is separated into the following modules:\n\n#### Input\nSource: [flair/hook/input](flair/hook/input)\n\n##### `bind_hotkey(combination, function)`\nAdds a hotkey which is only active when Freelancer is in the foreground.\n\n##### `unbind_hotkey(combination, function)`\nRemoves a hotkey that has been bound in the Freelancer window.\n\n##### `queue_display_text(text: str)`\nQueue text to be displayed to the user. If Freelancer is in the foreground and the chat box is closed,\nthis will be shown immediately. Otherwise, the text will be shown as soon as both these conditions are true.\n\n##### `send_message(message: str, private=True)`\nInserts `message` into the chat box and sends it. If `private` is true, send to the Console.\n\n##### `inject_keys(key: str, after_delay=0.0)`\nInject a key combination into the Freelancer window.\n\n##### `inject_text(text: str)`\nInject text into the chat box.\n\n##### `initialise_hotkey_hooks()`\nInitialise hotkey hooks for Freelancer. Should be run when, and only when, the Freelancer window is brought into\nthe foreground.\n\n##### `terminate_hotkey_hooks()`\nRelease hotkey hooks for Freelancer. Should be run when, and only when, the Freelancer window is put into the\nbackground.\n\n##### `on_chat_box_opened()`\nHandle the user opening the chat box. Emits the `chat_box_opened` signal.\n\n##### `on_chat_box_closed(cancelled=False)`\nHandle the user closing the chat box. Emits the `chat_box_closed` signal.\n\n##### `collect_chat_box_events(event)`\nHandle a keyboard event while the chat box is open.\n# Todo: handle arrow keys, copy and paste\n\n##### `get_chat_box_contents()`\nReturn (our best guess at) the current contents of the chat box. If it is closed, returns a blank string.\n\n##### `get_chat_box_open_hotkey()`\nReturn the hotkey configured to open the chat box.\n\n#### Process\nSource: [flair/hook/process](flair/hook/process)##### `get_process() -> <built-in function HANDLE>`\nReturn a handle to Freelancer's process.\n\n##### `read_memory(process, address, datatype, buffer_size=128)`\nReads Freelancer's process memory.\n\nJust as with string resources, strings are stored as UTF-16 meaning that the end of a string is marked by two\nconsecutive null bytes. However, other bytes will be present in the buffer after these two nulls since it is of\narbitrary size, and these confuse Python's builtin .decode and result in UnicodeDecodeError. So we can't use it.\n\n##### `get_value(process, key, size=None)`\nRead a value from memory. `key` refers to the key of an address in `READ_ADDRESSES`\n\n##### `get_string(process, key, length)`\nRead a UTF-16 string from memory.\n\n##### `get_name(process) -> str`\nRead the name of the active character from memory.\n\n##### `get_credits(process) -> int`\nRead the credit balance of the active character from memory.\n\n##### `get_position(process) -> Tuple[float, float, float]`\nRead the position of the active character from memory.\n\n##### `get_mouseover(process) -> str`\nThis is a really interesting address. It seems to store random, unconnected pieces of text that have been\nrecently displayed or interacted with in the game. These range from console outputs to the names of bases\nand planets immediately upon jumping in or docking, to the prices of commodities in the trader screen, to\nmission \"popups\" messages, to the name of some solars and NPCs that are moused over while in space.\nWith some imagination this can probably be put to some use...\n\n##### `get_rollover(process) -> str`\nSimilar to mouseover, but usually contains tooltip text.\n\n##### `get_last_message(process) -> str`\nRead the last message sent by the player from memory\n\n##### `get_chat_box_state(process) -> bool`\nRead the state of the chat box from memory.\n\n##### `get_character_loaded(process) -> bool`\nRead whether a character is loaded (whether in SP or MP).\n\n##### `get_docked(process) -> bool`\nRead whether the active character is docked.\n\n#### Window\nSource: [flair/hook/window](flair/hook/window)##### `get_hwnd() -> int`\nReturns a non-zero window handle to Freelancer if a window exists, otherwise, returns zero.\n\n##### `is_present() -> bool`\nReports whether Freelancer is running.\n\n##### `is_foreground() -> bool`\nReports whether Freelancer is in the foreground and accepting input.\n\n##### `get_screen_coordinates()`\nReturn the screen coordinates for the contents (\"client\"; excludes window decorations) of a Freelancer window.\n\n##### `make_borderless()`\nRemove the borders and titlebar from the game running in windowed mode.\nTodo: Windowed mode seems to cut off the bottom of the game. This is something that will need worked around.\n\n#### Storage\nSource: [flair/hook/storage](flair/hook/storage)##### `get_active_account_name() -> str`\nReturns the currently active account's code (\"name\") from the registry.\nNote that Freelancer reads the account from the registry at the time of server connect.\n\n##### `virtual_key_to_name(vk) -> str`\nGet the name of a key from its VK (virtual key) code.\n\n##### `get_user_keymap() -> Dict[str, str]`\nGet Freelancer's current key map as defined in UserKeyMap.ini, in a format understood by the `keyboard`\nmodule.\n\n##### `tail_chat_log()`\n(Discovery only)\nGet the last message recorded in DSAce.log\n\n##### `get_launcher_accounts() -> Dict[str, Tuple[str, str]]`\n(Discovery only)\nParse launcheraccounts.xml to a dictionary of tuples of the form {code: (name, description)}.\n\n### Augmentations\n\"Augmentations\" are modules that augment the game client. flair includes several such built-in example modules.\n\nTo create an augmentation, subclass `flair.augment.Augmentation`. Simply override the methods `load()` and `unload()`. These are run when augmentations are \"loaded\" into the game client and \"unloaded\" respectively. Connect up the events you need to use and add any other setup here.\n\nSource: [flair/augment](flair/augment)\n\n#### Clipboard\nAdds clipboard access to the chat box. Use Ctrl+Shift+C to copy the contents of the chat box and Ctrl+Shift+V to paste text to it.\n\n#### CLI\nAdds a basic command-line interface to the game.\nIf you are on a vanilla server you will need to type commands into the console (press \u00e2\u2020\u2018 in the chat box). This is not necessary on a server running FLHook as it will recognise them as commands and not send them to other players. Output is returned in chat, again through the console.\n\n- `date`: print the local date and time\n- `sector`: print the current sector and system\n- `eval`: evaluate the given expression with Python\n- `quit`: quit the game\n- `help`: show this help message\n\n#### Screenshot\nAdds proper screenshot functionality to the game, similar to that found in games like *World of Warcraft*. Screenshots are automatically named with a timestamp and the system name and saved to `My Games/Freelancer/Screenshots` with the character name as the directory. Screenshots are taken using Ctrl+PrintScreen.\n\n### To do\n- Reimplementing Wizou's multiplayer code\n- Increasing the robustness of determining the chat box contents - currently it does not handle arrow keys\n- Getting system and base is currently pretty hacky, and it often requires a dock and undock to set both after loading a character\n\n\n", "description_content_type": "text/markdown", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/biqqles/flair", "keywords": "", "license": "", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "fl-flair", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/fl-flair/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/fl-flair/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "https://github.com/biqqles/flair"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/fl-flair/0.1/", "requires_dist": ["deconstruct", "fl-flint", "keyboard (>=0.11.0)", "pywin32", "Pillow"], "requires_python": ">=3.6", "summary": "A novel client-side hook for Freelancer", "version": "0.1"}, "last_serial": 6857313, "releases": {"0.1": [{"comment_text": "", "digests": {"md5": "ee854d78a8f1742176d028d310a4e33f", "sha256": "8466ae8125d7c298e53f5187a34a07b3fd75096a085f168e44882e6a77e256ff"}, "downloads": -1, "filename": "fl_flair-0.1-py3-none-any.whl", "has_sig": false, "md5_digest": "ee854d78a8f1742176d028d310a4e33f", "packagetype": "bdist_wheel", "python_version": "py3", "requires_python": ">=3.6", "size": 23903, "upload_time": "2020-03-21T21:37:04", "upload_time_iso_8601": "2020-03-21T21:37:04.464419Z", "url": "https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/e2/eb/096df7f7365693cc3fc8bf4e51aee2ef9458a3df4466f9b3cbc10cb2e67e/fl_flair-0.1-py3-none-any.whl"}, {"comment_text": "", "digests": {"md5": "d29a1c9d0ae3951fc31f634b1519539e", "sha256": "161483fb9ccb14ddb0f1a6e13d4d70f05b2fd6789a41463a46ee6d490a307ab5"}, "downloads": -1, "filename": "fl-flair-0.1.tar.gz", "has_sig": false, "md5_digest": "d29a1c9d0ae3951fc31f634b1519539e", "packagetype": "sdist", "python_version": "source", "requires_python": ">=3.6", "size": 18777, "upload_time": "2020-03-21T21:37:07", "upload_time_iso_8601": "2020-03-21T21:37:07.304128Z", "url": "https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/f8/c1/291923d71441b35993bf1bde3e7d5dff8a198cdb39972fa1b21557d3a8c9/fl-flair-0.1.tar.gz"}]}, "urls": [{"comment_text": "", "digests": {"md5": "ee854d78a8f1742176d028d310a4e33f", "sha256": "8466ae8125d7c298e53f5187a34a07b3fd75096a085f168e44882e6a77e256ff"}, "downloads": -1, "filename": "fl_flair-0.1-py3-none-any.whl", "has_sig": false, "md5_digest": "ee854d78a8f1742176d028d310a4e33f", "packagetype": "bdist_wheel", "python_version": "py3", "requires_python": ">=3.6", "size": 23903, "upload_time": "2020-03-21T21:37:04", "upload_time_iso_8601": "2020-03-21T21:37:04.464419Z", "url": "https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/e2/eb/096df7f7365693cc3fc8bf4e51aee2ef9458a3df4466f9b3cbc10cb2e67e/fl_flair-0.1-py3-none-any.whl"}, {"comment_text": "", "digests": {"md5": "d29a1c9d0ae3951fc31f634b1519539e", "sha256": "161483fb9ccb14ddb0f1a6e13d4d70f05b2fd6789a41463a46ee6d490a307ab5"}, "downloads": -1, "filename": "fl-flair-0.1.tar.gz", "has_sig": false, "md5_digest": "d29a1c9d0ae3951fc31f634b1519539e", "packagetype": "sdist", "python_version": "source", "requires_python": ">=3.6", "size": 18777, "upload_time": "2020-03-21T21:37:07", "upload_time_iso_8601": "2020-03-21T21:37:07.304128Z", "url": "https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/f8/c1/291923d71441b35993bf1bde3e7d5dff8a198cdb39972fa1b21557d3a8c9/fl-flair-0.1.tar.gz"}]}
