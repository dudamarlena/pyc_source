I store them in the `playground` folder. The papers include:\n\n>- [`Auto-Encoding Variational Bayes`](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6114)\n>- [`mixup: BEYOND EMPIRICAL RISK MINIMIZATION`](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.09412.pdf)\n>- [`MINE: Mutual Information Neural Estimation`](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.04062)\n>- [`Averaging Weights Leads to Wider Optima and Better Generalization`](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.05407.pdf)\n>- [`THERE ARE MANY CONSISTENT EXPLANATIONS OF UNLABELED DATA: WHY YOU SHOULD AVERAGE`](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.05594.pdf)\n>- [`Prior-aware Neural Network for Partially-Supervised Multi-Organ Segmentation`](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.06346)\n\n\n---\n### Installation\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/jizongFox/deep-clustering-toolbox.git\ncd deep-clustering-toolbox  \npython setup install # for those who do not want to make changes immediately.\n# or\npython setup develop # for those who want to modify the code and make the impact immediate.\n\n```\nOr very simply\n```bash\npip install deepclustering\n```\n### Citation\nIf you feel useful for your project, please consider citing this work.\n```latex\n@article{peng2019deep,\n  title={Deep Co-Training for Semi-Supervised Image Segmentation},\n  author={Peng, Jizong and Estradab, Guillermo and Pedersoli, Marco and Desrosiers, Christian},\n  journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:1903.11233},\n  year={2019}\n}\n```\n\n\n", "description_content_type": "text/markdown", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/jizongFox/deep-clustering-toolbox", "keywords": "", "license": "MIT", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "deepclustering", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/deepclustering/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/deepclustering/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "https://github.com/jizongFox/deep-clustering-toolbox"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/deepclustering/0.0.2/", "requires_dist": ["msgpack", "numpy", "torch", "torchvision", "Pillow", "scikit-learn", "behave", "requests", "scikit-image", "pandas", "easydict", "matplotlib", "tqdm (==4.32.2)", "py (==1.8.0)", "pytest-remotedata (==0.3.1)", "tensorboardX", "tensorboard", "opencv-python", "medpy", "pyyaml", "termcolor", "gpuqueue", "gdown"], "requires_python": "", "summary": "", "version": "0.0.2"}, "last_serial": 6584696, "releases": {"0.0.2": [{"comment_text": "", "digests": {"md5": "19afc5c1582da70925c1b3ddc216dc08", "sha256": "1184c2d7611f90f691189927f9cf1434fcd67932362d66edf753851c1de41927"}, "downloads": -1, "filename": "deepclustering-0.0.2-py3-none-any.whl", "has_sig": false, "md5_digest": "19afc5c1582da70925c1b3ddc216dc08", "packagetype": "bdist_wheel", "python_version": "py3", "requires_python": null, "size": 267711, "upload_time": "2020-02-06T22:09:36", "upload_time_iso_8601": "2020-02-06T22:09:36.933566Z", "url": "https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/10/15/0b979021efa208e2f3cd24889360407af4fd5b75183f46aba015b1160782/deepclustering-0.0.2-py3-none-any.whl"}, {"comment_text": "", "digests": {"md5": "d88e61cdac0daa6237fcd152e2723702", "sha256": "447d9a823e9888b0238af5b35c4717f4f3a3e011549adbf581e8226d99054f11"}, "downloads": -1, "filename": "deepclustering-0.0.2.tar.gz", "has_sig": false, "md5_digest": "d88e61cdac0daa6237fcd152e2723702", "packagetype": "sdist", "python_version": "source", "requires_python": null, "size": 187372, "upload_time": "2020-02-06T22:09:38", "upload_time_iso_8601": "2020-02-06T22:09:38.714156Z", "url": "https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/36/8c/b2c401a9a8816789a108ae9460d7df7cc6352483d78f95c776cd8890bd26/deepclustering-0.0.2.tar.gz"}]}, "urls": [{"comment_text": "", "digests": {"md5": "19afc5c1582da70925c1b3ddc216dc08", "sha256": "1184c2d7611f90f691189927f9cf1434fcd67932362d66edf753851c1de41927"}, "downloads": -1, "filename": "deepclustering-0.0.2-py3-none-any.whl", "has_sig": false, "md5_digest": "19afc5c1582da70925c1b3ddc216dc08", "packagetype": "bdist_wheel", "python_version": "py3", "requires_python": null, "size": 267711, "upload_time": "2020-02-06T22:09:36", "upload_time_iso_8601": "2020-02-06T22:09:36.933566Z", "url": "https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/10/15/0b979021efa208e2f3cd24889360407af4fd5b75183f46aba015b1160782/deepclustering-0.0.2-py3-none-any.whl"}, {"comment_text": "", "digests": {"md5": "d88e61cdac0daa6237fcd152e2723702", "sha256": "447d9a823e9888b0238af5b35c4717f4f3a3e011549adbf581e8226d99054f11"}, "downloads": -1, "filename": "deepclustering-0.0.2.tar.gz", "has_sig": false, "md5_digest": "d88e61cdac0daa6237fcd152e2723702", "packagetype": "sdist", "python_version": "source", "requires_python": null, "size": 187372, "upload_time": "2020-02-06T22:09:38", "upload_time_iso_8601": "2020-02-06T22:09:38.714156Z", "url": "https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/36/8c/b2c401a9a8816789a108ae9460d7df7cc6352483d78f95c776cd8890bd26/deepclustering-0.0.2.tar.gz"}]}
