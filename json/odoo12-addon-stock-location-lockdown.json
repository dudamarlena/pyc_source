With this module, you will be able to enable a new option *Block stock entrance* for these locations.\n\n**Table of contents**\n\n.. contents::\n   :local:\n\nUsage\n=====\n\n* Once the module is installed, select any internal location for which you want to prevent stock entrance and check the box *Block Stock Entrance*. Then, you won't be allow to add stock on these locations.\n\nBug Tracker\n===========\n\nBugs are tracked on `GitHub Issues <https://github.com/OCA/stock-logistics-warehouse/issues>`_.\nIn case of trouble, please check there if your issue has already been reported.\nIf you spotted it first, help us smashing it by providing a detailed and welcomed\n`feedback <https://github.com/OCA/stock-logistics-warehouse/issues/new?body=module:%20stock_location_lockdown%0Aversion:%2012.0%0A%0A**Steps%20to%20reproduce**%0A-%20...%0A%0A**Current%20behavior**%0A%0A**Expected%20behavior**>`_.\n\nDo not contact contributors directly about support or help with technical issues.\n\nCredits\n=======\n\nAuthors\n~~~~~~~\n\n* Akretion\n\nContributors\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n* Florian da Costa <florian.dacosta@akretion.com>\n\nMaintainers\n~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThis module is maintained by the OCA.\n\n.. image:: https://odoo-community.org/logo.png\n   :alt: Odoo Community Association\n   :target: https://odoo-community.org\n\nOCA, or the Odoo Community Association, is a nonprofit organization whose\nmission is to support the collaborative development of Odoo features and\npromote its widespread use.\n\nThis module is part of the `OCA/stock-logistics-warehouse <https://github.com/OCA/stock-logistics-warehouse/tree/12.0/stock_location_lockdown>`_ project on GitHub.\n\nYou are welcome to contribute.
