When selected, the import is delayed in a background\njob.\n\nThis job in turn splits the CSV file in chunks of minimum\n100 lines (or more to align with record boundaries). Each\nchunk is then imported in a separate background job.\n\nWhen an import fails, the job is marked as such and the\nuser can read the error in the job status. The CSV chunk\nbeing imported is stored as an attachment to the job, making\nit easy to download it, fix it and run a new import, possibly\nin synchronous mode since the chunks are small.\n\nAny file that can be imported by the standard import mechanism\ncan also be imported in the background.\n\nThis module's scope is limited to making standard imports\nasynchronous. It does not attempt to transform the data nor\nautomate ETL flows.\n\nOther modules may benefit from this infrastructure in the following way\n(as illustrated in the test suite):\n\n1. create an instance of `base_import.import` and populate its fields\n   (`res_model`, `file`, `file_name`),\n2. invoke the `do` method with appropriate options\n   (`header`, `encoding`, `separator`, `quoting`,\n   `use_queue`, `chunk_size`).\n\nKnown issues / Roadmap\n======================\n\n* There is currently no user interface to control the chunk size,\n  which is currently 100 by default. Should this proves to be an issue,\n  it is easy to add an option to extend the import screen.\n* Validation cannot be run in the background.\n\nChangelog\n=========\n\n12.0.1.0.0 (2018-10-20)\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n* [MIGRATION] from 11.0 branched at rev. b0945be\n\nBug Tracker\n===========\n\nBugs are tracked on `GitHub Issues <https://github.com/OCA/queue/issues>`_.\nIn case of trouble, please check there if your issue has already been reported.\nIf you spotted it first, help us smashing it by providing a detailed and welcomed\n`feedback <https://github.com/OCA/queue/issues/new?body=module:%20base_import_async%0Aversion:%2012.0%0A%0A**Steps%20to%20reproduce**%0A-%20...%0A%0A**Current%20behavior**%0A%0A**Expected%20behavior**>`_.\n\nDo not contact contributors directly about support or help with technical issues.\n\nCredits\n=======\n\nAuthors\n~~~~~~~\n\n* Akretion\n* ACSONE SA/NV\n\nContributors\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nS\u00e9bastien Beau (Akretion) authored the initial prototype.\n\nSt\u00e9phane Bidoul (ACSONE) extended it to version 1.0 to support\nmulti-line records, store data to import as attachments\nand let the user control the asynchronous behaviour.\n\nOther contributors include:\n\n* Anthony Muschang (ACSONE)\n* David B\u00e9al (Akretion)\n* Jonathan Nemry (ACSONE)\n* Laurent Mignon (ACSONE)\n* Dennis Sluijk (Onestein)\n\nMaintainers\n~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThis module is maintained by the OCA.\n\n.. image:: https://odoo-community.org/logo.png\n   :alt: Odoo Community Association\n   :target: https://odoo-community.org\n\nOCA, or the Odoo Community Association, is a nonprofit organization whose\nmission is to support the collaborative development of Odoo features and\npromote its widespread use.\n\nThis module is part of the `OCA/queue <https://github.com/OCA/queue/tree/12.0/base_import_async>`_ project on GitHub.\n\nYou are welcome to contribute.
