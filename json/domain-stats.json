The SANS isc is providing some funding and will pay for whois API access.   This improves the data quality and reliability but it completely changes the way I access the data.  This requires a significant rewrite.  This is in a transitional state right now as I move from the old to the new. \n\n\nThis is a complete rewrite and new approach to managing baby domains in your organization.  Based on feedback from the community Domain_stats was really only used for baby domain information.  This new iteration focuses on that data and how to make it useful.  In this process it now tracks \"FIRST CONTACT\" so you know when your organization and/or the ISC has seen that domain before.\n\nThe domain stats client is focused on quickly giving you 5 pieces of data for every domain name you ask it for.  That is when the domain was first seen by you, when it was first seen by the security community and when it was first seen by the web.\n\nSEEN_BY_YOU - Values: Date First Seen by you\n\nSEEN_BY_ISC  - Values: NA or Date First seen by ISC  (NA indicates that it was resolved by the local database no ISC is required.)\n\nSEEN_BY_WEB - Values: CreationDate\n\nCATEGORY    - NEW or ESTABLISHED  (indicating whether it is less than 2 years old since the SEEN_BY_WEB date)\n\nALERT      -  List of alerts regarding this domain.   Including:\n              YOUR-FIRST-CONTACT  - This request is first time you have ever seen this domain on your network\n              ISC-FIRST-CONTACT  - This is the first time any domain_stats user has seen this domain on their network\n              <other>  - The ISC may add other alert for a domain \n\n\nHere are some examples of how these are useful.\nIf your SIEM sees a request for google.com that is not a new domain and has been established for may years. Your response may look like this:\n\n```\nstudent@573:~/Documents/domain_stats2$ wget -q -O- http://127.0.0.1:8000/google.com\n{\"seen_by_web\": \"1998-10-08 07:30:02\", \"seen_by_isc\": \"NA\", \"seen_by_you\": \"2019-12-24 15:30:02\", \"category\": \"ESTABLISHED\", \"alerts\": ['YOUR-FIRST-CONTACT']}\n```\nWhen the domain has been around for more than two years domain stats responds and tells you that is an \"ESTABLISHED\" domain.  Notice that ALERTS is set to \"YOUR-FIRST-CONTACT\". Since this is a brand new domain stats installation this is the first time my organization has ever queried google.  You will only see \"YOUR-FIRST-CONTACT\" once for each domain. Also \"SEEN_BY_ISC\" is set to NA indicating that this query was resolved locally by your domain client and it didn't need to talk to the ISC.  That means that this is a well known established domain that has been around for a long time and your local client has it in its database.  Generally speaking you can most likely ignore the NA SEEN_BY_ISC domains.\n\nLets look at another domain.  Look at markbaggett.com.\n\n```\nstudent@573:~/Documents/domain_stats2$ wget -q -O- http://127.0.0.1:8000/markbaggett.com\n{\"seen_by_web\": \"2015-12-12 19:34:59\", \"seen_by_isc\": \"2019-06-08 10:03:17\", \"seen_by_you\":\"2019-06-08 10:03:17\", \"category\": \"ESTABLISHED\", \"alerts\": ['YOUR-FIRST-CONTACT'] \n```\nThe domain markbaggett.com wasn't in the local database on my server so it had to go off and ask the SANS Internet Storm Center server for that information. It got back a \"seen_by_web\" date of 12-12-2015.  This is the domains registration date. The category indicates that this is an \"ESTABLISHED\" domain.  It will added to the client database for all future queries unless any additional alerts were set by the ISC. Domains that have an alert associated with them will be cached for 24 hours. Then another query will be sent to the ISC.  This process is repeated until the isc alert for that domain is cleared.  Notice there is a date for \"seen_by_isc\".  That is the first time ANYONE using domain_stats queried the central server for that domain. Someone using domain stats ask about that domain that back on July 8th. That is a few months ago so it isn't brand new to the community. If no one using domain stats had ever asked about that domain there would have been an additional alert that says \"ISC-FIRST-CONTACT\". Last we can see it is again the YOUR-FIRST-CONTACT alert for our organization.   \n\nA domain with a very recent \"seen_by_web\", \"seen_by_isc\" and \"seen_by_you\" date should be investigated. The vast majority of domains have been around for a few years before they are stable and gain popularity.  Domains used by attackers are usually established shortly before they are used. \n\nAnytime you see a \"???-FIRST-CONTACT\" on a domain that has been running for some period of time it is at the least a good thing to be aware of.  If it is the FIRST CONTACT for both you and the community then that is even more interesting. (Unless of course you are of the few beta testers where the community is very small and not much different that seen_by_you.)\n\n\n![Overview](overview.jpg)\n\n\nThe goal is to push as much of the \"ESTABLISHED\" data to the client local lan as possible. This minimizes network traffic keeps as much data as possible on the client network. When contacting the central server it will periodically inform the client to pull list of new domains and add them to the client established database.\n\nMore data to come later as features and functions are more firmly established.\n\nYou can check the efficiency of your domain_stats server cache with the following request.\n\n$ wget -q -O- http://127.0.0.1:8000/stats\nWill show statistics on the efficiency of the memory cache and the database hit rate.\n\n$ wget -q -O- http://127.0.0.1:8000/showcache\nWill dump the cache\n\n\n\n# ISC API Specification\nAPI requests look like this\n```\n{\"command\":  <command string>,  additional arguments depending upon command}\n```\nValid COMMANDS include \"CONFIG\", \"STATUS\", and \"QUERY\"\n\n\n\n### **CONFIG command requests configuration options the ISC would like to enforce on the client**\nrequest:\n```\n{\"command\": \"config\"}\n```\nresponse:\n```\n{\"min_software_version\": \"major.minor string\",  \"min_database_version\", \"major.minor string\", prohitited_tlds:[\"string1\",\"string2\"]}\n```\n- clients will not query ISC for Domains listed in prohibited_tlds.   Examples may be ['.local', '.arpa']\n- If min_software_version is higher than the client software version it causes the software to abort\n- if min_database_version is higher than database version it forces the client to download new domains from github.com/markbaggett and add it to its local database\n\n\n\n### **STATUS command allows the clients to tell the ISC how they are doing and see if they can continue.  This can be used to tune client efficiency and reduce ISC requests.**\nRequest:\n```\n{\"command\":\"status\", \"client_version\":client_version, \"database_version\":database_version, \"cache_efficiency\":[cache.hits, cache.miss, cache.expire], \"database_efficiency\":[database_stats.hits, database_stats.miss]}\n```\nResponse:\n```\n{\"interval\": \"integer number of minutes ISC wishes to wait until next status update\", \"deny_client\": \"client message string\"}\n```\n- interval: The interval tells the client how many minutes to wait before sending another status updates\n- deny_client: If set aborts the client with the specified message\n\n\n\n### **QUERY command allows clients to query a domain record.**\nRequests:\n```\n{\"command\": \"query\", \"domain\": \"example.tld\"}\n```\nRESPONSES (two possible):\n##### A success response looks like this:\n\n```\n{\"seen_by_web\": '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S', \"expires\": '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S', \"seen_by_isc\":'%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S', \"alerts\":['list','of','alerts]}\n```\n   - seen_by_web is the domains creation date from the whois record. The time stamp must be in '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S' format\n   - expires is the date that the domains registration expires from the whois record. The timestamp must be in '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S' format\n   - seen_by_isc is the date that the first domain_stats client requested this domain from the isc. If this was the first request it will have the current date and time and 'ISC-FIRST-CONTACT' will be added to the alerts. The timestamp must be in '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S' format.\n   - Alerts must include \"ISC-FIRST-CONTACT\" if this is the first time anyone has ever queried ISC for this domain\n   - Setting any additional alerts limits will cause the client record to not be commited to the database. Instead it is cached for 24 hours on the client.  After 24 hours the client will query the isc again.\n##### An error response looks like this:\n\n```\n{\"seen_by_web\":\"ERROR\", \"expires\":\"ERROR\", \"seen_by_isc\":<integer specifying cache time to live>, \"alerts\":['alerts','for','that','domain']}\n```\n   - seen_by_web and expires must be set to \"ERROR\" when an error has occured.\n   - Error time to live tell the client how long to cache and reuse the error for that domain.\n   - Integer > 0 - will cache the error for that many hours\n   - 0 - will not cache the error at all\n   - -1 - will cache it such that it does not expire, but the domain can still drop out of cache based on LRU algorithm\n   - -2 - PERMANENT cache entry.  Will never expire.  DANGEROUS. Use with caution.\n\n\n", "description_content_type": "text/markdown", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/markbaggett/domain_stats", "keywords": "", "license": "", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "domain-stats", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/domain-stats/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/domain-stats/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "https://github.com/markbaggett/domain_stats"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/domain-stats/0.0.6/", "requires_dist": ["python-dateutil", "pyyaml", "rdap", "requests"], "requires_python": ">=3.6", "summary": "Malicious Domain Detection base on domain creation and first contact", "version": "0.0.6"}, "last_serial": 6817217, "releases": {"0.0.1": [], "0.0.6": [{"comment_text": "", "digests": {"md5": "304d4b2849a6ad8439e11c8c65748f35", "sha256": "fa670baf1f58da0ffbedceac8b794f00f8aeaa6fd404f2629d4ccccabbec8e78"}, "downloads": -1, "filename": "domain_stats-0.0.6-py3-none-any.whl", "has_sig": false, "md5_digest": "304d4b2849a6ad8439e11c8c65748f35", "packagetype": "bdist_wheel", "python_version": "py3", "requires_python": ">=3.6", "size": 43390, "upload_time": "2020-03-15T21:40:03", "upload_time_iso_8601": "2020-03-15T21:40:03.957830Z", "url": "https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/5c/54/aa08a271351785d99c1624ad1dc3566fccea46288ad1daf4d358ead0fec6/domain_stats-0.0.6-py3-none-any.whl"}, {"comment_text": "", "digests": {"md5": "4a74ee8e8157830188013cd9b9829462", "sha256": "52081ecc82270513440da804bfba9fc77a483210210acf8b8112f5c1113d688a"}, "downloads": -1, "filename": "domain_stats-0.0.6.tar.gz", "has_sig": false, "md5_digest": "4a74ee8e8157830188013cd9b9829462", "packagetype": "sdist", "python_version": "source", "requires_python": ">=3.6", "size": 17712, "upload_time": "2020-03-15T21:40:05", "upload_time_iso_8601": "2020-03-15T21:40:05.318950Z", "url": "https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/8f/a0/3862babe31be2582cec94344e518fa901419238eae65e6c54954f664455b/domain_stats-0.0.6.tar.gz"}]}, "urls": [{"comment_text": "", "digests": {"md5": "304d4b2849a6ad8439e11c8c65748f35", "sha256": "fa670baf1f58da0ffbedceac8b794f00f8aeaa6fd404f2629d4ccccabbec8e78"}, "downloads": -1, "filename": "domain_stats-0.0.6-py3-none-any.whl", "has_sig": false, "md5_digest": "304d4b2849a6ad8439e11c8c65748f35", "packagetype": "bdist_wheel", "python_version": "py3", "requires_python": ">=3.6", "size": 43390, "upload_time": "2020-03-15T21:40:03", "upload_time_iso_8601": "2020-03-15T21:40:03.957830Z", "url": "https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/5c/54/aa08a271351785d99c1624ad1dc3566fccea46288ad1daf4d358ead0fec6/domain_stats-0.0.6-py3-none-any.whl"}, {"comment_text": "", "digests": {"md5": "4a74ee8e8157830188013cd9b9829462", "sha256": "52081ecc82270513440da804bfba9fc77a483210210acf8b8112f5c1113d688a"}, "downloads": -1, "filename": "domain_stats-0.0.6.tar.gz", "has_sig": false, "md5_digest": "4a74ee8e8157830188013cd9b9829462", "packagetype": "sdist", "python_version": "source", "requires_python": ">=3.6", "size": 17712, "upload_time": "2020-03-15T21:40:05", "upload_time_iso_8601": "2020-03-15T21:40:05.318950Z", "url": "https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/8f/a0/3862babe31be2582cec94344e518fa901419238eae65e6c54954f664455b/domain_stats-0.0.6.tar.gz"}]}
