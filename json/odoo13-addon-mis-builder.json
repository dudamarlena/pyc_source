Reports can be exported to PDF, Excel and they\ncan be added to Odoo dashboards.\n\n**Table of contents**\n\n.. contents::\n   :local:\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nYour preferred way to install addons will work with MIS Builder.\n\nAn easy way to install it with all its dependencies is using pip:\n\n* ``pip install --pre odoo12-addon-mis_builder``\n* then restart Odoo, update the addons list in your database, and install\n  the MIS Builder application.\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nTo configure this module, you need to:\n\n* Go to Accounting > Configuration > MIS Reporting > MIS Report Templates where\n  you can create report templates by defining KPI's. KPI's constitute the rows of your\n  reports. Such report templates are time independent.\n\n.. figure:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OCA/mis-builder/10.0/mis_builder/static/description/ex_report_template.png\n   :alt: Sample report template\n   :width: 80 %\n   :align: center\n\n* Then in Accounting > Reports > MIS Reporting > MIS Reports you can create report instance by\n  binding the templates to time periods, hence defining the columns of your reports.\n\n.. figure:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OCA/mis-builder/10.0/mis_builder/static/description/ex_report_settings.png\n   :alt: Sample report configuration\n   :width: 80 %\n   :align: center\n\n* From the MIS Reports view, you can preview the report, add it to and Odoo dashboard,\n  and export it to PDF or Excel.\n\n.. figure:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OCA/mis-builder/10.0/mis_builder/static/description/ex_report_preview.png\n   :alt: Sample preview\n   :width: 80 %\n   :align: center\n\nDevelopment\n===========\n\nA typical extension is to provide a mechanism to filter reports on analytic dimensions\nor operational units. To implement this, you can override _get_additional_move_line_filter\nand _get_additional_filter to further filter move lines or queries based on a user\nselection. A typical use case could be to add an analytic account field on mis.report.instance,\nor even on mis.report.instance.period if you want different columns to show different\nanalytic accounts.\n\nKnown issues / Roadmap\n======================\n\nThe mis_builder `roadmap <https://github.com/OCA/mis-builder/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aenhancement>`_\nand `known issues <https://github.com/OCA/mis-builder/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Abug>`_ can\nbe found on GitHub.\n\nChangelog\n=========\n\n13.0.3.6.0 (2020-03-28)\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n**Features**\n\n- Add column-level filters on analytic account and analytic tags.\n  These filters are combined with a AND with the report-level filters\n  and cannot be modified in the preview. (`#138 <https://github.com/OCA/mis-builder/issues/138>`_)\n- Access to KPI from other reports in KPI expressions, aka subreports. In a\n  report template, one can list named \"subreports\" (other report templates). When\n  evaluating expressions, you can access KPI's of subreports with a dot-prefix\n  notation. Example: you can define a MIS Report for a \"Balance Sheet\", and then\n  have another MIS Report \"Balance Sheet Ratios\" that fetches KPI's from \"Balance\n  Sheet\" to create new KPI's for the ratios (e.g. balance_sheet.current_assets /\n  balance_sheet.total_assets). (`#155 <https://github.com/OCA/mis-builder/issues/155>`_)\n\n\n13.0.3.5.0 (2020-01-??)\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nMigration to odoo 13.0.\n\n12.0.3.5.0 (2019-10-26)\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n**Features**\n\n- The ``account_id`` field of the model selected in 'Move lines source'\n  in the Period form can now be a Many2one\n  relationship with any model that has a ``code`` field (not only with\n  ``account.account`` model). To this end, the model to be used for Actuals\n  move lines can be configured on the report template. It can be something else\n  than move lines and the only constraint is that its ``account_id`` field\n  as a ``code`` field. (`#149 <https://github.com/oca/mis-builder/issues/149>`_)\n- Add ``source_aml_model_name`` field so extension modules providing\n  alternative data sources can more easily customize their data source. (`#214 <https://github.com/oca/mis-builder/issues/214>`_)\n- Support analytic tag filters in the backend view and preview widget.\n  Selecting several tags in the filter means filtering on move lines which\n  have *all* these tags set. This is to support the most common use case of\n  using tags for different dimensions. The filter also makes a AND with the\n  analytic account filter. (`#228 <https://github.com/oca/mis-builder/issues/228>`_)\n- Display company in account details rows in multi-company mode. (`#242 <https://github.com/oca/mis-builder/issues/242>`_)\n\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n- Propagate context to xlsx report, so the analytic account filter\n  works when exporting to xslx too. This also requires a fix to\n  ``report_xlsx`` (see https://github.com/OCA/reporting-engine/pull/259). (`#178 <https://github.com/oca/mis-builder/issues/178>`_)\n- In columns of type Sum, preserve styles for KPIs that are not summable\n  (eg percentage values). Before this fix, such cells were displayed without\n  style. (`#219 <https://github.com/oca/mis-builder/issues/219>`_)\n- In Excel export, keep the percentage point suffix (pp) instead of replacing it with %. (`#220 <https://github.com/oca/mis-builder/issues/220>`_)\n\n\n12.0.3.4.0 (2019-07-09)\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n**Features**\n\n- New year-to-date mode for defining periods. (`#165 <https://github.com/oca/mis-builder/issues/165>`_)\n- Add support for move lines with negative debit or credit.\n  Used by some for storno accounting. Not officially supported. (`#175 <https://github.com/oca/mis-builder/issues/175>`_)\n- In Excel export, use a number format with thousands separator. The\n  specific separator used depends on the Excel configuration (eg regional\n  settings). (`#190 <https://github.com/oca/mis-builder/issues/190>`_)\n- Add generation date/time at the end of the XLS export. (`#191 <https://github.com/oca/mis-builder/issues/191>`_)\n- In presence of Sub KPIs, report more informative user errors when\n  non-multi expressions yield tuples of incorrect lenght. (`#196 <https://github.com/oca/mis-builder/issues/196>`_)\n\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n- Fix rendering of percentage types in Excel export. (`#192 <https://github.com/oca/mis-builder/issues/192>`_)\n\n\n12.0.3.3.0 (2019-01-26)\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n**Features**\n\n*Dynamic analytic filters in report preview are not yet available in 11,\nthis requires an update to the JS widget that proved difficult to implement\nso far. Help welcome.*\n\n- Analytic account filters. On a report, an analytic\n  account can be selected for filtering. The filter will\n  be applied to move lines queries. A filter box is also\n  available in the widget to let the user select the analytic\n  account during report preview. (`#15 <https://github.com/oca/mis-builder/issues/15>`_)\n- Control visibility of analytic filter combo box in widget.\n  This is useful to hide the analytic filters on reports where\n  they do not make sense, such as balance sheet reports. (`#42 <https://github.com/oca/mis-builder/issues/42>`_)\n- Display analytic filters in the header of exported pdf and xls. (`#44 <https://github.com/oca/mis-builder/issues/44>`_)\n- Replace the last old gtk icons with fontawesome icons. (`#104 <https://github.com/oca/mis-builder/issues/104>`_)\n- Use active_test=False in AEP queries.\n  This is important for reports involving inactive taxes.\n  This should not negatively effect existing reports, because\n  an accounting report must take into account all existing move lines\n  even if they reference objects such as taxes, journals, accounts types\n  that have been deactivated since their creation. (`#107 <https://github.com/oca/mis-builder/issues/107>`_)\n- int(), float() and round() support for AccountingNone. (`#108 <https://github.com/oca/mis-builder/issues/108>`_)\n- Allow referencing subkpis by name by writing `kpi_x.subkpi_y` in expressions. (`#114 <https://github.com/oca/mis-builder/issues/114>`_)\n- Add an option to control the display of the start/end dates in the\n  column headers. It is disabled by default (this is a change compared\n  to previous behaviour). (`#118 <https://github.com/oca/mis-builder/issues/118>`_)\n- Add evaluate method to mis.report. This is a simplified\n  method to evaluate kpis of a report over a time period,\n  without creating a mis.report.instance. (`#123 <https://github.com/oca/mis-builder/issues/123>`_)\n\n**Bugs**\n\n- In the style form, hide the \"Hide always\" checkbox when \"Hide always inherit\"\n  is checked, as for all other syle elements. (`#121 <https://github.com/OCA/mis-builder/pull/121>_`)\n\n**Upgrading from 3.2 (breaking changes)**\n\nIf you use ``Actuals (alternative)`` data source in combination with analytic\nfilters, the underlying model must now have an ``analytic_account_id`` field.\n\n\n11.0.3.2.2 (2018-06-30)\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n* [FIX] Fix bug in company_default_get call returning\n  id instead of recordset\n  (`#103 <https://github.com/OCA/mis-builder/pull/103>`_)\n* [IMP] add \"hide always\" style property to make hidden KPI's\n  (for KPI that serve as basis for other formulas, but do not\n  need to be displayed).\n  (`#46 <https://github.com/OCA/mis-builder/issues/46>`_)\n\n11.0.3.2.1 (2018-05-29)\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n* [FIX] Missing comparison operator for AccountingNone\n  leading to errors in pbal computations\n  (`#93 <https://github.com/OCA/mis-builder/issue/93>`_)\n\n10.0.3.2.0 (2018-05-02)\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n* [FIX] make subkpi ordering deterministic\n  (`#71 <https://github.com/OCA/mis-builder/issues/71>`_)\n* [ADD] report instance level option to disable account expansion,\n  enabling the creation of detailed templates while deferring the decision\n  of rendering the details or not to the report instance\n  (`#74 <https://github.com/OCA/mis-builder/issues/74>`_)\n* [ADD] pbal and nbal accounting expressions, to sum positive\n  and negative balances respectively (ie ignoring accounts with negative,\n  resp positive balances)\n  (`#86 <https://github.com/OCA/mis-builder/issues/86>`_)\n\n11.0.3.1.2 (2018-02-04)\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nMigration to Odoo 11.
