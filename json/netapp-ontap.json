It provides support for several underlying services, including connection\nmanagement, asynchronous request processing, and exception handling. By using the Python\nclient library, you can quickly develop robust code to support the automation of your ONTAP\ndeployments.\n\n# Getting started\n\n## Software requirements\nBefore installing the Python client library, you must make sure the following packages are\ninstalled on your system:  \n\n* python 3.5 or later  \n* requests 2.21.0 or later  \n* marshmallow 3.2.1 or later  \n\n\n## Installing and importing the package\nYou must install the package using the pip utility:\n\n```\npip install netapp-ontap\n```\n\nAfter installing the package, you can import the objects you need into your application:\n\n```python\nfrom netapp_ontap.resources import Volume, Snapshot\n```\n\n## Creating an object\n\nYou can create an object in several different ways. Here are three examples of\ncreating an equivalent `netapp_ontap.resources.volume` object.\n\n```python\nfrom netapp_ontap.resources import Volume\n\n# Example 1 - keyword arguments\nvolume = Volume(name='vol1', svm={'name': 'vs1'}, aggregates=[{'name': 'aggr1'}])\n\n# Example 2 - dict as keyword arguments\ndata = {\n    'name': 'vol1',\n    'svm': {'name': 'vs1'},\n    'aggregates': [{'name': 'aggr1'}],\n}\nvolume = Volume(**data)\n\n# Example 3 - using the from_dict() method\nvolume = Volume.from_dict({\n    'name': 'vol1',\n    'svm': {'name': 'vs1'},\n    'aggregates': [{'name': 'aggr1'}],\n})\n```\n\n## Performing actions on an object\n\nAfter you create an object, you can perform actions on the object based\non the purpose and design of your application. The example below illustrates\nhow to create a new volume and then take a snapshot.\n\nNote that when using the library, in all cases you must first establish a\nconnection to the management LIF of the ONTAP system using the\n`netapp_ontap.host_connection.HostConnection` object. In the example below,\nthe connection is created and then set as the global default.\nThis means that all objects and the associated actions reuse\nthis same connection. See *Host connections* for more information.\n\n```python\nfrom netapp_ontap import config\nfrom netapp_ontap.host_connection import HostConnection\nfrom netapp_ontap.resources import Volume, Snapshot\n\nconfig.CONNECTION = HostConnection('myhost.mycompany.com', 'username', 'password')\n\nvolume = Volume(name='vol1', svm={'name': 'vs1'}, aggregates=[{'name': 'aggr1'}])\nvolume.post()\nsnapshot = Snapshot.from_dict({\n    'name': '%s_snapshot' % volume.name,\n    'comment': 'A snapshot of %s' % volume.name,\n    'volume': volume.to_dict(),\n})\nsnapshot.post()\n```\n\n# Host connections\n\nThe `netapp_ontap.host_connection.HostConnection` object allows a client application\nto store credentials once and reuse them for each subsequent operation.\nYou can do this in any of the following ways:\n\n* Use the connection object as a context manager with the **with** keyword.\n\n* Call the function `set_connection()` on a specific resource so the connection is used for\nall actions on the resource.\n\n* Set the `netapp_ontap.config.CONNECTION` variable to establish a single connection instance for all\noperations within the scope of that block. This allows you to connect to ONTAP once\nand use the same connection everywhere, instead of providing credentials every time you make a\nrequest.\n\nNote that you can call `get_connection()` to get the connection used by an object and use it for\nsubsequent operations.\n\nBy default, every operation attempts to verify the SSL certificate for the connection. If a\ncertificate cannot be verified, the **SSLError** exception is thrown. You can disable this\nverification by setting `netapp_ontap.host_connection.HostConnection.verify` to false when creating the\n`netapp_ontap.host_connection.HostConnection` instance.\n\n## Custom headers\n\nIn some cases, you might want to set and send custom headers with the REST request.\nThis can be done at the connection level. For a specific connection, you can pass in\nthe headers you would like to send for each request within the scope of that connection object.\nThe library provides full access to the request headers so that you can update, add, or delete\nheaders from the same connection object at any point. If a header is not recognized by ONTAP,\nit is ignored.\n\n```python\nfrom netapp_ontap import config, HostConnection\nheaders = {'my-header1':'my-header-value1', 'my-header2':'my-header-value2'}\n\n#Initialize a connection object with custom headers\nconfig.CONNECTION = HostConnection('myhost.mycompany.com', 'username', 'password', headers=headers)\n\n#Delete a header from a connection object\nconn = HostConnection('myhost.mycompany.com', 'username', 'password', headers=headers)\ndel conn.request_headers['my-header1']\n\n#Add a header to a connection object using the assignment operator\nconn = HostConnection('myhost.mycompany.com', 'username', 'password', headers=headers)\nconn.request_headers['mynew-header'] = 'mynew-header-value'\n\n#Add headers to a connection object\nconfig.CONNECTION = HostConnection('myhost.mycompany.com', 'username' 'password')\nconfig.CONNECTION.request_headers = headers\n\n#Update an existing header using the assignment operator\nconfig.CONNECTION = HostConnection('myhost.mycompany.com','username','password', headers=headers)\nconfig.CONNECTION.request_headers['my-header1'] = 'my-new-header'\n```\n\n# Asynchronous processing and jobs\n\nAll POST, PATCH, and DELETE requests that can take more than two seconds to complete are\ndesigned to run asynchronously as non-blocking operations. These operations are executed\nas background jobs at the ONTAP cluster. The HTTP response generated by an\nasynchronous request always contains a link to the associated job object. By default, an\nasynchronous request automatically polls the job using the unique job identifier in the link.\nControl is returned to your script when a terminal state is reached (success or failure) or\nthe configured timeout value expires. However, you can override this behavior by setting the\n**poll** value to false when calling the function, causing control to return before the job\ncompletes. Forcing an immediate return can be useful when a job might take a long time to\ncomplete and you want to continute execution of the script.\n\n# Responses\n\nA request always returns a `netapp_ontap.response.NetAppResponse` object which contains the details\nof the HTTP response. It contains information such as whether the response is an error\nor a job. Refer to `netapp_ontap.response.NetAppResponse` for further information on how\nto check the details of the response.\n\n# Exception handling\n\nBy default, an exception is returned if a request returns an HTTP status code of 400 or greater.\nThe exception object, which is of type `netapp_ontap.error.NetAppRestError`,\nholds the HTTP response object so that the exception can be handled in the client code.\nIf you wish not to raise exceptions, you can set `netapp_ontap.config.RAISE_API_ERRORS` to false. In this case,\nit is up to the client to check the HTTP response from the `netapp_ontap.response.NetAppResponse`\nobject and handle any errors. Refer to `netapp_ontap.error.NetAppRestError` for further information.\n\n```python\n# Set RAISE_API_ERRORS to False and check the HTTP response.\nconfig.RAISE_API_ERRORS = False\nresponse = Svm.find(name = \"nonexistent_vs)\nassert \"entry doesn't exist\" in response.http_response.text\n```\n\n# Debugging\n\nWhile writing your application, it can often be useful to see the raw HTTP request and response\ntext that the library is sending to and from the server. There are two flags that can be set\nto help with this.\n\n## DEBUG flag\n\nThe first is the DEBUG flag. This can be set either by setting DEBUG=1 in the environment prior\nto executing your application or by setting `netapp_ontap.utils.DEBUG` to 1 inside of your application.\nThis flag, when set, will cause the library to log the request and response for any failed\nAPI call. This will be logged at DEBUG level (see the section on logging for setting up your\napplication). Here's an example of setting this value inside of your application:\n\n```python\nimport logging\n\nfrom netapp_ontap import HostConnection, NetAppRestError, config, utils\nfrom netapp_ontap.resources import Volume\n\nlogging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)\nconfig.CONNECTION = HostConnection('10.100.200.50', username='admin', password='password', verify=False)\n\n# Set the DEBUG flag to 1\nutils.DEBUG = 1\n\n# this API call will fail with a 404\ntry:\n    volume = Volume(uuid=\"1\", name='does_not_exist')\n    volume.get()\nexcept NetAppRestError:\n    print('We got an expected exception')\n```\n\nHere is what the output would look like:\n\n```\n$ python test_debug.py\nDEBUG:urllib3.util.retry:Converted retries value: 5 -> Retry(total=5, connect=None, read=None, redirect=None, status=None)\nDEBUG:urllib3.connectionpool:Starting new HTTPS connection (1): 10.100.200.50:443\nDEBUG:urllib3.connectionpool:https://10.100.200.50:443 \"GET /api/storage/volumes/1 HTTP/1.1\" 404 130\nDEBUG:netapp_ontap.utils:\n-----------REQUEST-----------\nGET https://10.100.200.50:443/api/storage/volumes/1\nAccept: */*\nUser-Agent: python-requests/2.21.0\nConnection: keep-alive\nAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflate\nX-Dot-Client-App: netapp-ontap-python-9.8.0\nAuthorization: Basic YWRtaW46cGFzc3dvcmQK\nNone\n-----------------------------\n\n-----------RESPONSE-----------\n404 Not Found\nDate:Tue, 12 Nov 2019 13:00:24 GMT\nServer:libzapid-httpd\nX-Content-Type-Options: nosniff\nCache-Control: no-cache,no-store,must-revalidate\nContent-Length: 130\nContent-Type: application/hal+json\nKeep-Alive: timeout=5, max=100\nConnection:Keep-Alive\n{\n  \"error\": {\n    \"message\": \"\\\"1\\\" is an invalid value for field \\\"uuid\\\" (<UUID>)\",\n    \"code\": \"2\",\n    \"target\": \"uuid\"\n  }\n}\n------------------------------\nWe got an expected exception\n$\n```\n\n## LOG_ALL_API_CALLS flag\n\nThere is also a LOG_ALL_API_CALLS flag which can be set in the same ways. You can\nset it in the environment or during script execution by setting `netapp_ontap.utils.LOG_ALL_API_CALLS`\nto 1. This flag will produce the same output as above, but it will log the call no\nmatter if there was a failure or not. Here's an example of what that would look\nlike if we got an existing volume:\n\n```python\nimport logging\n\nfrom netapp_ontap import HostConnection, config, utils\nfrom netapp_ontap.resources import Volume\n\nlogging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)\nconfig.CONNECTION = HostConnection('10.100.200.50', username='admin', password='password', verify=False)\n\n# Set the LOG_ALL_API_CALLS flag to 1\nutils.LOG_ALL_API_CALLS = 1\n\n# this API call will succeed and be logged\nvolume = list(Volume.get_collection())[0]\n```\n\nHere is what the output would look like:\n\n```\n$ python test_debug.py\nDEBUG:urllib3.util.retry:Converted retries value: 5 -> Retry(total=5, connect=None, read=None, redirect=None, status=None)\nDEBUG:urllib3.connectionpool:Starting new HTTPS connection (1): 10.100.200.50:443\nDEBUG:urllib3.connectionpool:https://10.100.200.50:443 \"GET /api/storage/volumes HTTP/1.1\" 200 567\nDEBUG:netapp_ontap.utils:\n-----------REQUEST-----------\nGET https://10.100.200.50:443/api/storage/volumes\nUser-Agent: python-requests/2.21.0\nConnection: keep-alive\nAccept: */*\nAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflate\nX-Dot-Client-App: netapp-ontap-python-9.8.0\nAuthorization: Basic YWRtaW46cGFzc3dvcmQK\nNone\n-----------------------------\n\n-----------RESPONSE-----------\n200 OK\nDate:Tue, 12 Nov 2019 13:14:01 GMT\nServer:libzapid-httpd\nX-Content-Type-Options: nosniff\nCache-Control: no-cache,no-store,must-revalidate\nContent-Length: 567\nContent-Type: application/hal+json\nKeep-Alive: timeout=5, max=100\nConnection:Keep-Alive\n{\n  \"records\": [\n    {\n      \"uuid\": \"c68bdca8-d090-11e9-bb29-005056bb7f42\",\n      \"name\": \"vs0_root\",\n      \"_links\": {\n        \"self\": {\n          \"href\": \"/api/storage/volumes/c68bdca8-d090-11e9-bb29-005056bb7f42\"\n        }\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"uuid\": \"ed3b6ebf-d48e-11e9-bb29-005056bb7f42\",\n      \"name\": \"vs1_root\",\n      \"_links\": {\n        \"self\": {\n          \"href\": \"/api/storage/volumes/ed3b6ebf-d48e-11e9-bb29-005056bb7f42\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"num_records\": 2,\n  \"_links\": {\n    \"self\": {\n      \"href\": \"/api/storage/volumes\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n------------------------------\n$\n```\n\n# Additional considerations\n\nIn most cases, the objects and actions in the library can be mapped directly\nto equivalent cURL commands run against the ONTAP REST interface. However, there are a few\nexceptions you should be aware of.\n\n## Property names\n\nIf a property of a resource is named the same as one of the Python reserved names,\nthe name is transposed when accessing the member of the resource. For example,\nif there is a resource named \"Foo\" that has a property defined in the API named \"class\",\nthe property name would instead be \"class_\" when using the library. For example:\n\n```python\nfrom netapp_ontap.resources import Foo\n\nfoo = Foo()\nfoo.class_ = \"high\"\n```\n\n# Documentation\nTo view the full documentation, visit https://library.netapp.com/ecmdocs/ECMLP2858435/html/index.html\nor to view an offline copy, see the `<python_environment>/lib/<python_version>/site_packages/netapp_ontap/docs`\nDocumentation of ONTAP's REST APIs and other helpful resources can be found at https://devnet.netapp.com/restapi.\n\n# Compatibility\n\nThe version assigned to the library consists of the major ONTAP release it is generated\nfrom and a minor version for the library within that release. The minor version allows the\nlibrary to be updated within the same ONTAP release. For example, valid versions for\nthe library associated with ONTAP 9.6 include 9.6.0, 9.6.1, and so on.\n\nClient libraries that have the same major version as ONTAP are completely compatible.\nFor example, the libraries netapp-ontap-9.6.1 and netapp-ontap-9.6.4 are fully\ncompatible with both ONTAP 9.6 and ONTAP 9.6P1.\n\nA client library with a major version that does not match the ONTAP release can still be\nused, however it will not be fully compatible with the REST API. For example, the library\nnetapp-ontap-9.6.4 is only partially compatible with ONTAP 9.7. In these cases, the\nlibrary may encounter unknown fields or APIs. When this occurs, the library will ignore\nunknown fields, return an error, or raise a runtime exception.\n\n# Changelog\n\nThere are several changes to the Python Client Library and the ONTAP REST API, which are organized by release below.\n\n## 9.7.0 GA library updates  \n(2020-01-23)\n\n**Fixed issues**\n\n* [Bug ID 1279507](https://mysupport.netapp.com/NOW/cgi-bin/bol?Type=Detail&Display=1279507)  \n  When doing a find() with the fields query parameter, the library was not returning the specified fields, instead, all fields were being returned.\n\n* [Bug ID 1291333](https://mysupport.netapp.com/NOW/cgi-bin/bol?Type=Detail&Display=1291333)  \n  When 0 records are found in a Resource.find() call and LOG_ALL_API_CALLS is set to True, then an uncaught exception is raised.\n\n\n## 9.7.0 RC1 library updates  \n(2019-11-20)\n\n**New**\n\n* The application can now add its own custom headers for each request as part of the `netapp_ontap.host_connection.HostConnection` object.\n* When passing verify=False to the HostConnection, the library will now disable urllib3's InsecureRequestWarning from logging messages.\n\n**Incompatibilities**\n\n* In prior versions, Resource.find() would raise an exception if no results were found as well as when more than one was found. In this version, when no results are found, None is returned instead of raising an exception. An exception is still raised when more than one result is found.\n\n**Fixed issues**\n\n* [Bug ID 1271450](https://mysupport.netapp.com/NOW/cgi-bin/bol?Type=Detail&Display=1271450)  \n  The library doesn't allow sending a body in a DELETE request.\n\n* [Bug ID 1263312](https://mysupport.netapp.com/NOW/cgi-bin/bol?Type=Detail&Display=1263312)  \n  When POSTing or PATCHing some objects with embeded objects, fields might incorrectly be dropped from the request.\n\n* [Bug ID 1275238](https://mysupport.netapp.com/NOW/cgi-bin/bol?Type=Detail&Display=1275238)  \n  Retrieving and setting the \"from\" field of Autosupport object fails.\n\n##ONTAP 9.7 REST API updates\n\nAll new ONTAP APIs have corresponding library resource objects which can be used\nto perform the operations. See the `netapp_ontap.resources` package for details\nabout each of the objects and their fields.\n\nFor a summary of the changes in the ONTAP REST API between versions of ONTAP 9, see the [ONTAP 9
