To disable this feature, on the form view of\nthe company disable the *Allow Spread Planning* option.\n\nOn the form view of the company, the *Auto-post spread lines* option forces the account moves created\nduring the cost/revenue spreading to be automatically posted. When this option is false, the user can\nenable/disable the automatic posting by the flag *Auto-post lines* present in the spread board.\n\nOn the form view of the company, enable the *Auto-archive spread* option if you want the\ncron job to automatically archive the spreads when all lines are posted.\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nDefine Spread Costs/Revenues Board\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nUnder Invoicing -> Adviser -> Accounting Entries -> Spread Costs/Revenues, create a new spread board.\n\nComplete the definition of the spreading criteria, by setting the the fields:\n\n* *Debit Account*\n* *Credit Account*\n* *Estimated Amount* (The total amount to spread)\n* *Number of Repetitions*\n* *Period Type* (Duration of each period)\n* *Start date*\n* *Journal*\n\n.. figure:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OCA/account-financial-tools/12.0/account_spread_cost_revenue/static/description/spread.png\n   :alt: Create a new spread board\n\nClick on the button on the top-left to calculate the spread lines.\n\n.. figure:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OCA/account-financial-tools/12.0/account_spread_cost_revenue/static/description/create_spread.png\n   :alt: The spreading board is defined\n\nA cron job will automatically create the accounting moves for all the lines having date previous that the current day (today).\n\n.. figure:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OCA/account-financial-tools/12.0/account_spread_cost_revenue/static/description/update_spread.png\n   :alt: The spreading board is updated by the cron job\n\nBy default, the status of the created accounting moves is posted.\nTo disable the automatic posting of the accounting moves, set the flag *Auto-post lines* to False.\nThis flag is only available when the *Auto-post spread lines* option, present on the form view of the company, is disabled.\n\nClick on button *Recalculate entire spread* button in the spread board to force the recalculation of the spread lines:\nthis will also reset all the journal entries previously created.\n\nLink Invoice to Spread Costs/Revenues Board\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nCreate an invoice or vendor bill in draft. On its lines, the spreading right-arrow icon are displayed in dark-grey color.\n\n.. figure:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OCA/account-financial-tools/12.0/account_spread_cost_revenue/static/description/invoice_line_1.png\n   :alt: On the invoice line the spreading icon is displayed\n\nClick on the spreading right-arrow icon. A wizard prompts to enter a *Spread Action Type*:\n\n- *Link to existing spread board*\n- *Create from spread template*\n- *Create new spread board*\n\nSelect *Link to existing spread board* and enter the previously generated Spread Board. Click on Confirm button:\nthe selected Spread Board will be automatically displayed.\n\nGo back to the draft invoice/bill. The spreading functionality is now enabled on the invoice line:\nthe spreading right-arrow icon is now displayed in green color.\n\n.. figure:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OCA/account-financial-tools/12.0/account_spread_cost_revenue/static/description/invoice_line_2.png\n   :alt: On the invoice line the spreading icon is displayed in green color\n\nValidate the invoice/bill. Click on the spreading (green) right-arrow icon to open the spread board, then click\non the smart button *Reconciled entries*: the moves of the spread lines are reconciled with the move of the invoice line.\n\nIn case the Subtotal Price of the invoice line is different than the *Estimated Amount* of the spread board, the spread\nlines (not yet posted) will be recalculated when validating the invoice/bill.\n\nDefine Spread Costs/Revenues Template\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nUnder Invoicing -> Configuration -> Accounting -> Spread Templates, create a new spread template.\n\n* *Spread Type*\n* *Spread Balance Sheet Account*\n* *Journal*\n\nWhen creating a new Spread Costs/Revenues Board, select the right template.\nThis way the above fields will be copied to the Spread Board.\n\nChangelog\n=========\n\n12.0.1.0.0\n~~~~~~~~~~\n\n* [MIG] Port account_spread_cost_revenue to V12.\n\n\n11.0.1.0.0\n~~~~~~~~~~\n\n* [ADD] Module account_spread_cost_revenue.\n  (`#715 <https://github.com/OCA/account-financial-tools/pull/715>`_)\n\nBug Tracker\n===========\n\nBugs are tracked on `GitHub Issues <https://github.com/OCA/account-financial-tools/issues>`_.\nIn case of trouble, please check there if your issue has already been reported.\nIf you spotted it first, help us smashing it by providing a detailed and welcomed\n`feedback <https://github.com/OCA/account-financial-tools/issues/new?body=module:%20account_spread_cost_revenue%0Aversion:%2012.0%0A%0A**Steps%20to%20reproduce**%0A-%20...%0A%0A**Current%20behavior**%0A%0A**Expected%20behavior**>`_.\n\nDo not contact contributors directly about support or help with technical issues.\n\nCredits\n=======\n\nAuthors\n~~~~~~~\n\n* Onestein\n\nContributors\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n* Andrea Stirpe <a.stirpe@onestein.nl>\n\nOther credits\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nPart of the code in this module (in particular the computation of the spread lines)\nis highly inspired by the Assets Management module from the standard\nOdoo 11.0 Community developed by Odoo SA.\n\nMaintainers\n~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThis module is maintained by the OCA.\n\n.. image:: https://odoo-community.org/logo.png\n   :alt: Odoo Community Association\n   :target: https://odoo-community.org\n\nOCA, or the Odoo Community Association, is a nonprofit organization whose\nmission is to support the collaborative development of Odoo features and\npromote its widespread use.\n\n.. |maintainer-astirpe| image:: https://github.com/astirpe.png?size=40px\n    :target: https://github.com/astirpe\n    :alt: astirpe\n\nCurrent `maintainer <https://odoo-community.org/page/maintainer-role>`__:\n\n|maintainer-astirpe| \n\nThis module is part of the `OCA/account-financial-tools <https://github.com/OCA/account-financial-tools/tree/12.0/account_spread_cost_revenue>`_ project on GitHub.\n\nYou are welcome to contribute.
