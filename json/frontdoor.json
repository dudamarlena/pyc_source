The idea is you can copy ``frontdoor.py`` into your\nrepository to make it easy to bootstrap a front door script of your own\n(the other files in this repo are just examples that illustrate how\nfrontdoor.py is used).\n\nA front door script is a command which accepts a series of options which\nthemselves may defer to other commands or processes which do work of\nsome kind.\n\nSo say you have a project that has unit tests, integration tests, and\ndeployment scripts. Typically you'd include a series of scripts, along\nwith documentation on what scripts do what and how. What makes a front\ndoor script different is that you just document it's available and users\ncan find other options by jumping in and exploring it themselves. The\nend result feels a little like playing an interactive fiction computer\ngame such as Zork.\n\nThis solves a different use case from argparse as argparse is more about\ncreating robust, single purpose tools that can be invoked in flexible\nways, where as Front Door is about creating scripts that more easily\naccept positional arguments and can defer to other commands. It's also\nextremely simple and designed to be copy and pasted.\n\n.. |Build Status| image:: https://travis-ci.org/TimSimpson/frontdoor.svg?branch=mas\n   :target: https://travis-ci.org/TimSimpson/frontdoor\n.. |Build status| image:: https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/dfwa2mv8wskx6x6r?svg=true\n   :target: https://ci.appveyor.com/project/TimSimpson/frontdoor", "description_content_type": "", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "", "keywords": "", "license": "MIT", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "frontdoor", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/frontdoor/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/frontdoor/", "project_urls": null, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/frontdoor/0.1.2/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": "", "summary": "Aids the creation of \"front door\" scripts.", "version": "0.1.2"}, "last_serial": 3746904, "releases": {"0.1.2": [{"comment_text": "", "digests": {"md5": "5725d75d38514ca75c58e458c731b487", "sha256": "91e3484a669ff3e8ca5ed3cd27902e137e51091c8280f6c274f4cd9743dafc83"}, "downloads": -1, "filename": "frontdoor-0.1.2.tar.gz", "has_sig": false, "md5_digest": "5725d75d38514ca75c58e458c731b487", "packagetype": "sdist", "python_version": "source", "requires_python": null, "size": 3425, "upload_time": "2018-04-08T22:10:53", "upload_time_iso_8601": "2018-04-08T22:10:53.326137Z", "url": "https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/fe/ad/1e682a8f37680dd1edc77519a87a6c1bc94a327f854828b2ebdee72ae6fa/frontdoor-0.1.2.tar.gz"}]}, "urls": [{"comment_text": "", "digests": {"md5": "5725d75d38514ca75c58e458c731b487", "sha256": "91e3484a669ff3e8ca5ed3cd27902e137e51091c8280f6c274f4cd9743dafc83"}, "downloads": -1, "filename": "frontdoor-0.1.2.tar.gz", "has_sig": false, "md5_digest": "5725d75d38514ca75c58e458c731b487", "packagetype": "sdist", "python_version": "source", "requires_python": null, "size": 3425, "upload_time": "2018-04-08T22:10:53", "upload_time_iso_8601": "2018-04-08T22:10:53.326137Z", "url": "https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/fe/ad/1e682a8f37680dd1edc77519a87a6c1bc94a327f854828b2ebdee72ae6fa/frontdoor-0.1.2.tar.gz"}]}
