Go to *Inventory > operations > Inventory Adjustments*.\n#. Create new inventory with \"Select products manually\" option.\n#. Start inventory.\n#. Click to \"Scan barcodes\" smart button.\n#. Start reading barcodes.\n\nBarcode interface for picking operations\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nYou can use the barcode interface in a picking or an operation type, the main\ndifference is that if you open the barcode interface from a picking, this\npicking is locked and you read products for it.\n\nTo use the barcode interface on picking operations:\n\n#. Go to *Inventory*.\n#. Click on scanner button on any operation type.\n#. Start reading barcodes.\n\nTo use the barcode interface on a picking:\n\n#. Go to *Inventory > Transfers*.\n#. Click to \"Scan barcodes\" smart button.\n#. Start reading barcodes.\n\nThe barcode scanner interface has two operation modes. In both of them user\ncan scan:\n\n#. Warehouse locations with barcode.\n#. Product packaging with barcode.\n#. Product with barcode.\n#. Product Lots (The barcode is name field in this case).\n\n\nAutomatic operation mode\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThis is the default mode, all screen controls are locked to avoid scan into\nfields.\n\nThe user only has to scan barcode in physical warehouse locations with a\nscanner hardward, the interface read the barcode and do operations in this\norder:\n\n#. Try search a product, if found, is assigned to product_id field and creates\n   or update inventory line with 1.0 unit. (If product has tracking by lots\n   the interface wait for a lot to be scanned).\n#. Try search a product packaging, if found, the product_id related is set,\n   product quantities are updated and create or update inventory line with\n   product quantities defined in the product packaging.\n#. Try search a lot (The product is mandatory in this case so you first scan a\n   product and then scann a lot), this lot field is not erased until that\n   product change, so for each product scann the interface add or update a\n   inventory line with this lot.\n#. Try to search a location, if found the field location is set and next scan\n   action will be done with this warehouse location.\n\nIf barcode has not found, when message is displayed you can create this lot\nscanning the product.\n\nManual entry mode\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nYou can change to \"manual entry data\" to allow to select data without scanner\nhardware, but hardward scanner still active on, so a use case would be when\nuser wants set quantities manually instead increment 1.0 unit peer scan action.\n\nScan logs\n~~~~~~~~~\n\nAll scanned barcodes are saved into model.\nBarcode scanning interface display 10 last records linked to model, the goal of\nthis log is show to user other reads with the same product and location done\nby other users.\nUser can remove the last read scan.\n\nKnown issues / Roadmap\n======================\n\n* Excute action_done() method outside onchange environment.\n* Allow create product when a barcode has not been found.\n* Allow to select picking reading its barcode.\n* Allow to select multiple pickings to process scanned products.\n\nChangelog\n=========\n\n11.0.1.1.0 (2019-09-24)\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n* [ADD] New feature.\n  User can uses barcode interface in picking operations.\n\nBug Tracker\n===========\n\nBugs are tracked on `GitHub Issues <https://github.com/OCA/stock-logistics-barcode/issues>`_.\nIn case of trouble, please check there if your issue has already been reported.\nIf you spotted it first, help us smashing it by providing a detailed and welcomed\n`feedback <https://github.com/OCA/stock-logistics-barcode/issues/new?body=module:%20stock_barcodes%0Aversion:%2013.0%0A%0A**Steps%20to%20reproduce**%0A-%20...%0A%0A**Current%20behavior**%0A%0A**Expected%20behavior**>`_.\n\nDo not contact contributors directly about support or help with technical issues.\n\nCredits\n=======\n\nAuthors\n~~~~~~~\n\n* Tecnativa\n\nContributors\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n\n* `Tecnativa <https://www.tecnativa.com>`_:\n\n  * Sergio Teruel\n  * Carlos Dauden\n  * Pedro M.
