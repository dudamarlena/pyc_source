Some plugins might require others to be\nrun before their functionality is accessible (such as calculating metrics on fixations and detecting fixations). They\nalso assert these assumptions.\n\n## Install from source\nThe sourcecode is available via git at https://bitbucket.org/fahrensiesicher/perceptionengineerstoolkit/src\n1. Install dependencies\\\n    `pip install cython wheel numpy tabel yapsy pyyaml pillow`\\\n    `pip install scipy sklearn pomegranate matplotlib pandas h5py`\n\n    You can get rid of the second set of dependencies if you deactivate certain plugins that require those. The core library does not make direct use of them. For a list of plugin dependencies see `toolbox.py`\n\n2. Running the examples\\\n    `python toolbox.py -C test/commandlist.yaml`\\\n    `python toolbox.py -D test/scripttest.py`\n\n## Interfacing with the toolbox\nYou can run your own analysis either through a YAML command file (see `test/commandlist.yaml` for an example) or through a custom python script (see `test/scripttest.py` for an example).\n\n\n## License\nThis work is double-licensed.
