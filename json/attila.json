It is both possible to send single AT commands indicating what response is expected and AT scritps which indicate all the commands to send, the expected response for each command, what information to store for each command and define an alternative behaviour in case of unexpected responses.  \nThese are the main functionalities that ATtila provides:\n\n- Sending individual AT command to RF module/modem through serial port and get the response for them\n- Sending of multiple AT commands using \u201cATScripts\u201d. ATScripts in particular allows you to:\n  - Define a set of commands to execute on the RF module\n  - Get the response and choose what information to store for each commands\n  - Use the response of a certain command in a command which will be executed later\n  - Define alternative behaviour in case of error\n\nATtila comes with a binary (which should be used instead of chat in my opinion) or for anything you want.\nYou can run ATtila binary with\n\n```sh\npython3 -m attila\n```\n\n```txt\nUsage: attila [OPTION]... [FILE]\n\n  With no FILE, run in interactive mode\n\n  -p  <device path>     Use this device to communicate\n  -b  <baud rate>       Use the specified baudrate to communicate\n  -T  <default timeout> Use the specified timeout as default to communicate\n  -B  <break>           Use the specified line break [CRLF, LF, CR, NONE] (Default: CRLF)\n  -A  <True/False>      Abort on failure (Default: True)\n  -L  <logfile>         Enable log and log to the specified log file (stdout is supported)\n  -l  <loglevel>        Specify the log level (0: CRITICAL, 1: ERROR, 2: WARN, 3: INFO, 4: DEBUG) (Default: INFO)\n  -v                    Be more verbose\n  -q                    Be quiet (print only PRINT ESKs and ERRORS)\n  -h                    Show this page\n```\n\n## Requirements\n\n- Python3.5 (>= 1.2.0)\n  - Python3.4 (up to 1.1.4)\n- pyserial3\n\n## Implementation\n\nIn order to build your own implementation using ATtila these are the steps you'll need to follow:\n\n1. The first thing you have to do is import the AT Runtime Environment and the exceptions it can raise in your project:  \n  ```from attila.atre import ATRuntimeEnvironment```  \n  ```from attila.exceptions import ATREUninitializedError, ATRuntimeError, ATScriptNotFound, ATScriptSyntaxError, ATSerialPortError```\n2. Instance an ATRuntimeEnvironment object:  \n  ```atrunenv = ATRuntimeEnvironment(abort_on_failure)```\n3. Configure the communicator, the component which will communicate with your device:  \n  ```atrunenv.configure_communicator(device, baud_rate, default_timeout, line_break)```\n4. Open the serial port (Be careful, this function can return a ATSerialPortError):  \n  ```atrunenv.open_serial()```\n5. Choose how to parse commands:\n   1. Parse an ATScript (parse_ATScript can raise ATScriptNotFound or ATScriptSyntaxError):  \n    ```atrunenv.parse_ATScript(script_file)```\n   2. Execute directly a command (or an ESK):\n    ```response = atrunenv.exec(command_str)```\n   3. Add an ATCommand to the session:\n    ```atrunenv.add_command(command_str)```\n6. Execute commands:\n   1. Run everything at once and then get a list of ATResponse (if abort_on_failure is True, the ATRE will raise ATRuntimeError during execution):  \n    ```response_list = atrunenv.run()```\n   2. Run one command a time (if abort_on_failure is True, the ATRE will raise ATRuntimeError):\n    ```response = atrunenv.exec_next()```\n7. Collect the values you need:  \n  ```rssi = atrunenv.get_session_value(\"rssi\")```\n8. Close serial: ```atrunenv.close_serial()```\n\n### Virtual Device\n\nSince version 1.1.0, it is possible to use a virtual serial device, instead of a real one. This has been introduced for tests purpose, but can actually used in cases where you need to emulate a serial device and you want to keep using ATtila.\nIn this case, in the ATRE, instead of using configure_communicator use:\n\n```py\ndef configure_virtual_communicator(self, serial_port, baud_rate, timeout = None, line_break = \"\\r\\n\", read_callback = None, write_callback = None, in_waiting_callback = None)\n```\n\nThe virtual communicator, in addition to the standard one, requires a read, a write and an in waiting callback. These callbacks must replace the I/O operations of the serial device, with something else (e.g. a socket with an HTTP request)\n\n## ATScript\n\n### ATScript Introduction\n\nATScript is the most important feature of ATtila, since it allows to execute a set of AT commands (*well, not only AT based to be honest...*) sequentially and evaluate, store and combine their output.\n\nBasically in an AT scripts there are three things:\n\n- **Commands**: describe what you want to send to the device and how to treat its response.\n- **Environment Setup Keywords**: describes how to establish and manage the communication.\n- **Comments**: you can obviously put comments in the ATScripts, the ATScriptParser will just ignore them. A comment statement must start with '#' character.\n\n### ATScript Commands\n\nObviously the most important feature of ATScripts is the possibility to execute AT Commands.\nAs far as we\u2019ve learned up to now, we know that a command has the following parameters:\n\n- the **command** itself\n- the **response** we expect\n- the **doppelganger** and it's expected response\n- **collectables**\n- a **delay** (milliseconds to wait before its execution)\n- a **timeout**\n\nSo basically, to think it easy, the syntax for commands will be a combination of them:\n\n```txt\nCOMMAND;;RESPONSE_EXPR;;DELAY;;TIMEOUT;;[\"COLLECTABLE1\",\"...\",\"COLLECTABLEn\"];;DOPPELGANGER;;DOPPELGANGER_RESPONSE\n```\n\nTo see practical applications of them, let's see a few examples.\n\n#### Examples\n\nWe\u2019ll start with a simple one: the \"AT\" command\n\nThe most basic usable syntax is just:\n\n##### Basic command\n\n```txt\nAT\n```\n\n##### Command and expected response\n\nbut you probably want at least to verify if its response is what you expect:\n\n```txt\nAT;;OK\n```\n\nWe told ATtila that we expect to find \u201cOK\u201d in the command response.\nWe can also use a regex in the expected response, for example if a command returns 16 hex digits, we can use\n\n```txt\nAT+GSN;;^[0-9,A-F]{16}$\n```\n\n##### Delay and timeout\n\nThen we can also add a delay before command execution (in milliseconds) and a timeout (in seconds)\n\n```txt\nAT;;OK;;1000;;5\n```\n\nThese commands don\u2019t have all the available parameters, we still need to go deep and the see **doppelgangers and collectables** concepts.\n\n#### Doppelgangers\n\nIn the previous example we\u2019ve seen the basic parameters associated to a command, but now I want to introduce you the doppelganger feature included in ATScripts. Imagine for instance that we want to set the SIM pin, but only if it requires to be unlocked (This is a situation I\u2019ve encountered many times at job where there could be devices with locked and unlocked PIN, but the chat script was the same).\nWe\u2019ll use AT+CPIN?, in case the SIM is unlocked it will return \u201c+CPIN:READY\u201d; we want to set the PIN only if returns something else. (If locked, returns \u201cCPIN:SIM PIN\u201d)\nThe command we\u2019ll use is:\n\n```txt\nAT+CPIN?;;READY;;0;;5;;;;AT+CPIN=7782;;OK\n```\n\nWhat does this command mean?\nIt tells ATtila to send AT+CPIN? and that we expect to find \"READY\" string in the response. If READY is found in the response it will proceed with the next command, but what happens for example if the device answers with \u201c+CPIN: SIM PIN\u201d? The ATSession will set as next command its doppelganger, which is AT+CPIN=7782, which will be executed as the next command.\n\n#### Collectables\n\nThe last, but not least important parameter you can set in a command is collectables.\nCollectables are values that you can collect from a command response and transform into a **session value** (we\u2019ll talk about session values in the next chapter).\nImagine for example you want to collect the current signal quality and store it into a variable you want for example to save on Redis, you can do it just by specifying what you\u2019re looking for and the session value name and the job is done: ATila will do the job for you!\n\n```txt\nAT+CSQ;;+CSQ;;0;;5;;[\"AT+CSQ=?{rssi},\",\"AT+CSQ=${rssi},?{ber}\"]\n```\n\nThis command has two collectables, which are the rssi and the Ber. We know that AT+CSQ, in case of a positive response (+CSQ:...), will return the **rssi and the ber** after \u201cAT+CSQ=\u201d separated by a comma. Imagine that we want to get both. The first value we want is located after \u201cAT+CSQ=\u201d and terminates with the ',' comma before the ber. So we tell ATtila to get a value between these two strings and to store it into a session value called \u201crssi\u201d. The other value will be located after the other part of the string; we can as you can see, reuse the rssi value in the second collectable (since rssi is already set).\nThe syntax which describes the start of a collectable is **?{SESSION_KEY}**.\n\nThis was a simple case, where we knew the value where between 'AT+CSQ=...,' and after 'AT+CSQ=rssi,...'. But sometimes we have to get a value which hasn't anything around. An example of this case is AT+CGSN, which returns the IMEI. The IMEI is returned on a line, with nothing around:\n\n```txt\nAT+CGSN\n123456789012345\nOK\n```\n\nHow can we get this value using collectables? Well, we can, but making a collectable a little more bit complex. We need to use a key regex:\n\n```txt\nAT+CGSN;;OK;;;;;;[\"?{IMEI::^[0-9]{15}$}\"]\n```\n\nThis means we're looking for a value between nothing, but which has to respect the regex we provided which is ```^[0-9]{15}$```. If a number of 15 digits is found in the response, this value will be stored into the session storage into a key named \"IMEI\".\nThe separator between the **key name** and the **key regex** is ```::```\nThis mechanism can also be used to solve ambiguity in the response to get the value that we really want.\n\nFor example we can make a more severe check on the CSQ using:\n\n```txt\nAT+CSQ;;OK;;;;;;[\"AT+CSQ=?{rssi::[0-9]{1,2}},\",\"AT+CSQ=${rssi},?{ber::[0-9]{1,2}}\"]\n```\n\n#### Session Values\n\nWe\u2019ve seen that session values are values we can store using collectables and also setting environment variables and through Environment Setup Keywords, but we\u2019ll see that in the next chapter.\nA session value **is just a key associated to a value**, stored in the **session storage**. The session storage is a dictionary made up of all the session values, it lives only for the current command set, when a new session is instanced, the session storage is empty again.\n*It\u2019s not that complicated.*\n\nWe can rethink the previous example of CPIN using session values.\nThe script which set the SIM PIN only if locked, could be a part of an image installed on plenty of devices, but we can\u2019t have a different script for each device and using a script which replace runtime the text with the configured PIN is not such a good way to do things.\nHere is where the power of session values comes in help!\nThe SIM pin could be for instance, written example in a configuration file and we want to set it as a session value.\nIf before the execution of our script, we execute \u201cexport SIM_PIN=7782\u201d and then we execute this row in ATila using GETENV (we'll see what GETENV is in the next chapter) somewhere in the script before its execution.\n\n```txt\nGETENV SIM_PIN\nAT+CPIN;;READY;;0;;5;;;;AT+CPIN=${SIM_PIN};;OK\n```\n\nSIM_PIN will be replaced by 7782.\n\nBut as we seen in the previous chapter, Session values can also be used to get collectables (if we already know a value that will be for sure in the response).\n\n### Environment Setup Keywords\n\nAs said before, ATScripts are not made only up of commands, but also of another thing called **Environment Setup Keywords (ESKs)**.\nLet\u2019s start from talking briefly about how ATtila works. ATtila has two main components: the **AT Runtime Environment (ATRE)** and the **ATSession**. The AT Runtime Environment instances a session and executes it following its commands, when the session execution ends, a new session can be instanced and the previous one gets destroyed, while the runtime environment persists. While **commands describe the ATSession execution path**, the **ESKs describe the setup for the AT Runtime Environment**, not only at the initial setup, but also at any time during runtime. ESKs can also be used to invoke the ATRE to execute some commands as we'll see..\nSo, to summarize, **ESKs are commands you can put (but are not mandatory) in your scripts and tell the Runtime Environment how to configure its components or extra instructions to be executed**.\nLet\u2019s see then which ESKs are supported.\n\n| ESK      | Value                         | Description                                                                                              |\n|----------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| DEVICE   | String                        | Indicates the target device used to communicate (e.g. /dev/ttyUSB0)                                      |\n| BAUDRATE | Int                           | Describes the baud rate used to communicate (e.g. 9600)                                                  |\n| TIMEOUT  | Int                           | Describes the default command timeout (e.g. 5)                                                           |\n| BREAK    | \"LF\" / \"CRLF\" / \"CR\" / \"NONE\" | Describes the line break used for commands between LF and CRLF                                           |\n| AOF      | True / False                  | Abort on failure: describes whether the runtime environment shut abort on command failure                |\n| SET      | String=String                 | Tells ATRE to set a session value with a certain key and value: (e.g. SET SIM=7789)                      |\n| GETENV   | String                        | Tells ATRE to store in session storage a certain environmental variable.
