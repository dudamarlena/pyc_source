If everything succeeded, you should \nsee something like `Successfully installed data_slicer` towards the end.\n\n4) Test the installation by running a test script:\n```\n(testenv) $ python -m data_slicer.tests.cool_test\n```\nThis should bring up a window with some example data.\n\n\n## Footnotes\n\n(footnote 1) You most likely have many different python packages installed on \nyour systems, like matplotlib, numpy, scipy, etc. These all have a specific \nversion. Certain packages, however, depend on specific versions of other \npackages and may not work if you have the wrong version installed. Obviously, \nwith many packages, this bears the potential of becoming very messy and \ncomplicated. That's the main reason virtual environments have been created. \nThe idea is, to create an isolated environment of you python install, \ncompletely separate from your system installation or other virtual \nenvironments. The new environment comes without any additional packages \n(usually). So if you were to list your installed packages of your system \ninstall with the command `pip freeze` like this:\n```\n$ pip freeze\nmatplotlib==2.2.4\nnumpy==1.13.1\n[...]\n```\nit would look like this, once you are \"in\" a newly created environment:\n```\n(env) $ pip freeze\n[nothing]\n```\n.\nEverything you install into this virtual environment only lives there, \nkeeping your system installation \"clean\".\nIt is also possible to have varying python versions and more things, but \nthat's the gist of it.\n\n\n\n\n", "description_content_type": "text/markdown", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/kuadrat/data_slicer.git", "keywords": "", "license": "", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "data-slicer", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/data-slicer/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/data-slicer/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "https://github.com/kuadrat/data_slicer.git"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/data-slicer/0.0.1/", "requires_dist": ["matplotlib (>=3.1.1)", "numpy (>=1.17.3)", "PyOpenGL (>=3.1.1a1)", "pyqtgraph (>=0.10.0)", "PyQt5 (>=5.13.2)"], "requires_python": "", "summary": "Tools for quick visualization of three dimensional datasets.", "version": "0.0.1"}, "last_serial": 6142608, "releases": {"0.0.1": [{"comment_text": "", "digests": {"md5": "c7f2721780552ac99e1b80bc1c5888ff", "sha256": "0458e4a906af7c5ef58e7497d7655db447e9dd2a562052ef8182c5753e91196a"}, "downloads": -1, "filename": "data_slicer-0.0.1-py3-none-any.whl", "has_sig": false, "md5_digest": "c7f2721780552ac99e1b80bc1c5888ff", "packagetype": "bdist_wheel", "python_version": "py3", "requires_python": null, "size": 1380775, "upload_time": "2019-11-15T10:55:34", "upload_time_iso_8601": "2019-11-15T10:55:34.347915Z", "url": "https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/66/0a/2cc0fafeb93e23ad846543cdcc7d5806e587cb590cd28941d02d447aa3b0/data_slicer-0.0.1-py3-none-any.whl"}]}, "urls": [{"comment_text": "", "digests": {"md5": "c7f2721780552ac99e1b80bc1c5888ff", "sha256": "0458e4a906af7c5ef58e7497d7655db447e9dd2a562052ef8182c5753e91196a"}, "downloads": -1, "filename": "data_slicer-0.0.1-py3-none-any.whl", "has_sig": false, "md5_digest": "c7f2721780552ac99e1b80bc1c5888ff", "packagetype": "bdist_wheel", "python_version": "py3", "requires_python": null, "size": 1380775, "upload_time": "2019-11-15T10:55:34", "upload_time_iso_8601": "2019-11-15T10:55:34.347915Z", "url": "https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/66/0a/2cc0fafeb93e23ad846543cdcc7d5806e587cb590cd28941d02d447aa3b0/data_slicer-0.0.1-py3-none-any.whl"}]}
