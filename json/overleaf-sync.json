No paid account necessary.\n\n----\n\n## Features\n- Sync your locally modified `.tex` (and other) files to your Overleaf projects\n- Sync your remotely modified `.tex` (and other) files to computer\n- Works with free Overleaf account\n- No Git or Dropbox required\n- Does not steal or store your login credentials (works with a persisted cookie, [check yourself](https://github.com/moritzgloeckl/overleaf-sync/blob/master/olsync/olclient.py#L34))\n\n## How To Use\n### Install\nThe package is available via PyPI. Just run:\n\n```\nmoritz@github:~/test$ pip install overleaf-sync\n```\n\nThat's it!\n\n### Prerequisites\n- Create your project on overleaf.com, for example `test`. The tool is not able to create projects (yet).\n- Create a folder with the same name as the project (`test`) on your computer\n- Execute the script from that folder (`test`)\n\n### Usage\n#### Login\n```\nmoritz@github:~/test$ ols login [-u/--username -p/--pasword --path]\nUsername: <overleaf username>\nPassword: <overleaf password>\nLogin successful. Cookie persisted as `.olauth`. You may now sync your project.\n```\n\nYou can either specify your username and/or password on the command line or you will be prompted to enter them. The `login` command logs you into Overleaf and stores your *cookie* (**not** your login credentials) in a hidden file called `.olauth` in the same folder you run the command from. It is possible to store the cookie elsewhere using the `--path` option. The cookie file will not be synced to or from Overleaf.\n\n### Syncing\n```\nmoritz@github:~/test$ ols [-l/--local-only -r/--remote-only --store-path -p/--path -i/--olignore]\n```\n\nJust calling `ols` will two-way sync your project. When there are changes both locally and remotely you will be asked which file to keep. Using the `-l` or `-r` option you can specify to either sync local project files to Overleaf only or Overleaf files to local ones only respectively. The option `--store-path` specifies the path of the cookie file created by the `login` command. If you did not change its path you do not need to specify this argument. The `-p/--path` option allows you to specify a different sync folder than the one you're calling `ols` from. The `-i/--olignore` option allows you to specify the path of `.olignore` file which works exactly like `.gitignore`.\n\nSample Output:\n\n```\nProject queried successfully.\n\u2705  Querying project\nProject downloaded successfully.\n\u2705  Downloading project\n\nSyncing files from remote to local\n====================\n\n[SYNCING] report.tex\nreport.tex does not exist on local. Creating file.\n\n[SYNCING] other-report.tex\nother-report.tex does not exist on local. Creating file.\n\n\n\u2705  Syncing files from remote to local\n```\n\n## Known Bugs\n- When modifying a file on Overleaf and immediately syncing afterwards, the tool might not detect the changes. Please allow 1-2 minutes after modifying a file on Overleaf before syncing it to your local computer.\n- When syncing from local to remote, files (including the ones in sub-directories) will all be synced to the root directory under Overleaf project (i.e., if local files under different folder share a same name, only the last synced file will be on Overleaf).\n\n## Disclaimer\nTHE AUTHOR OF THIS SOFTWARE AND THIS SOFTWARE IS NOT ENDORSED BY, DIRECTLY AFFILIATED WITH, MAINTAINED, AUTHORIZED, OR SPONSORED BY OVERLEAF OR WRITELATEX LIMITED.
