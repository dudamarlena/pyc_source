This is work in progress and we are continuously working on improving various aspects of it. It is released as learning aid and example kit for the API integrators. This is not recommended by Cashfree for direct use in production code. Please report any bugs to Cashfree at techsupport@cashfree.com.\n# cashfree-sdk-python\n\nThe official Cashfree SDK for Python3,\n\nGet started quickly using Cashfree with the Cashfree SDK for python. The SDK helps take the complexity out of coding by providing Python objects for Cashfree services including Payouts, Payment Gateway, Marketplace and Autocollect. The single, downloadable package includes the Cashfree Python Library and documentation.\n\nPlease refer to the [Cashfree Docs](https://docs.cashfree.com/docs/)  for the complete API reference.\n\n## Installing\n### In Django or Flask Application for Python 3.5+\n\nThe preferred way to install the Cashfree SDK for Python is to use the [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) package manager for pip. Simply type the following into a terminal window:\n```sh\npip3 install cashfree-sdk\n```\n\n## Getting Started\n### Pre-requisites\n  - A [Cashfree Merchant Account](https://merchant.cashfree.com/merchant/sign-up)\n  - API keys for different products. You can generate them from your Dashboard\n### IP Whitelisting and dynamic IPs\nYour IP has to be whitelisted to hit Cashfree's server. Or if you have a dynamic IP please pass in the public key parameter during the init method as shown below. For more information please go [here](https://dev.cashfree.com/development/quickstart#ip-whitelisting).\n## Usage\n### Payouts\nThe package needs to be configured with your account's secret key which is available in your Cashfree Dashboard.\nInit the package with your credentials and add the below code in your config.py of your package.\n##### In case of static IP (Your IP is whitelisted)\n```python\n\nfrom cashfree_sdk.payouts import Payouts\n\n//Initialize Cashfree Payout\nPayouts.init(\"<client_id>\", \"<client_secret>\", \"PROD\")\n```\n##### In case of dynamic IP you will need a public key to generate a signature(which will be done by sdk itself)\n\n```python\n\nfrom cashfree_sdk.payouts import Payouts\n\n//Initialize Cashfree Payout\nPayouts.init(\"<client_id>\", \"<client_secret>\", \"PROD\", public_key_path='/User/Cashfree/file_path.pem')\n// OR\nPayouts.init(\"<client_id>\", \"<client_secret>\", \"PROD\", public_key= b'public key')\n```\n\n\n| Option              | Default                       | Description                                                                           |\n| ------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `env`        | `TEST`                        | Environment to be initialized.
