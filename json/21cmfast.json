WARNING: If POWER_SPECTRUM==5 the cosmo parameters cannot be altered, they\n  are set to the Planck2018 best-fit values for now (until CLASS is added):\n  (omegab=0.02237, omegac= 0.120, hubble=0.6736 (the rest are irrelevant for the\n  transfer functions, but in case:  A_s=2.100e-9, n_s=0.9649, z_reio = 11.357)\n* New ``user_params`` option ``USE_RELATIVE_VELOCITIES``, which produces initial relative\n  velocity cubes (option implemented, but not the actual computation yet).\n* Configuration management.\n* global params now has a context manager for changing parameters temporarily.\n\nChanged\n~~~~~~~\n* ``POWER_SPECTRUM`` option moved from ``global_params`` to ``user_params``.\n* Default cosmology updated to Planck18.\n\nv2.0.0\n------\nAll changes and equations for this version are found in https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.08995.\n\nChanged\n~~~~~~~\n\n* Updated the ionizing source model: (i) the star formation rates and ionizing escape\n  fraction are scaled with the masses of dark matter halos and (ii) the abundance of\n  active star forming galaxies is exponentially suppressed below the turn-over halo\n  mass, M_{turn}, according to a duty cycle of exp(\u2212M_{turn}/M_{h}), where M_{h} is a\n  halo mass.\n* Removed the mean free path parameter, R_{mfp}. Instead, directly computes\n  inhomogeneous, sub-grid recombinations in the intergalactic medium following the\n  approach of Sobacchi & Mesinger (2014)\n\n\n\n\nv1.2.0\n------\nAdded\n~~~~~\n* Support for a halo mass dependent ionizing efficiency: zeta = zeta_0 (M/Mmin)^alpha,\n  where zeta_0 corresponds to  HII_EFF_FACTOR, Mmin --> ION_M_MIN,\n  alpha --> EFF_FACTOR_PL_INDEX in ANAL_PARAMS.H\n\n\nv1.12.0\n-------\nAdded\n~~~~~\n- Code 'redshift_interpolate_boxes.c' to interpolate between comoving cubes,\n  creating comoving light cone boxes.\n- Enabled openMP threading  for SMP machines.  You can specify the number of threads\n  (for best performace, do not exceed the number of processors) in INIT_PARAMS.H. You do\n  not need to have an SMP machine to run the code. NOTE: YOU SHOULD RE-INSTALL FFTW to\n  use openMP (see INSTALL file)\n- Included a threaded driver file 'drive_zscroll_reion_param.c' set-up to perform\n  astrophysical parameter studies of reionization\n- Included explicit support for WDM cosmologies; see COSMOLOGY.H.  The prescription is\n  similar to that discussed in Barkana+2001; Mesinger+2005, madifying the (i) transfer\n  function (according to the Bode+2001 formula; and (ii) including the effective\n  pressure term of WDM using a Jeans mass analogy.  (ii) is approximated with a sharp\n  cuttoff in the EPS barrier, using 60* M_J found in Barkana+2001 (the 60 is an\n  adjustment factor found by fitting to the WDM collapsed fraction).\n- A Gaussian filtering step of the PT fields to perturb_field.c, in addition to the\n  implicit boxcar smoothing.  This avoids having\"empty\" density cells, i.e. \\delta=-1,\n  with some small loss in resolution.  Although for most uses \\delta=-1 is ok, some Lya\n  forest statistics do not like it.\n- Added treatment of the risidual electron fraction from X-ray heating when computing\n  the ionization field.  Relatedly, modified Ts.c to output all intermediate evolution\n  boxes, Tk and x_e.\n- Added a missing factor of Omega_b in Ts.c corresponding to eq. 18 in MFC11.  Users who\n  used a previous version should note that their results just effecively correspond to a\n  higher effective X-ray efficiency, scaled by 1/Omega_baryon.\n- Normalization optimization to Ts.c, increasing performace on arge resolution boxes\n\n\nFixed\n~~~~~\n- GSL interpolation error in kappa_elec_pH for GSL versions > 1.15\n- Typo in macro definition, which impacted the Lya background calculation in v1.11 (not applicable to earlier releases)\n- Outdated filename sytax when calling gen_size_distr in drive_xHIscroll\n- Redshift scrolling so that drive_logZscroll_Ts.c and Ts.c are in sync.\n\nChanged\n~~~~~~~\n- Output format to avoid FFT padding for all boxes\n- Filename conventions to be more explicit.\n- Small changes to organization and structure\n\n\nv1.1.0\n------\nAdded\n~~~~~\n- Wrapper functions mod_fwrite() and mod_fread() in Cosmo_c_progs/misc.c, which\n  should fix problems with the library fwrite() and fread() for large files (>4GB) on\n  certain operating systems.\n- Included print_power_spectrum_ICs.c program which reads in high resolution initial\n  conditions and prints out an ASCII file with the associated power spectrum.\n- Parameter in Ts.c for the maximum allowed kinetic temperature, which increases\n  stability of the code when the redshift step size and the X-ray efficiencies are large.\n\nFixed\n~~~~~\n- Oversight adding support for a Gaussian filter for the lower resolution field.", "description_content_type": "", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/21cmFAST/21cmFAST", "keywords": "Epoch of Reionization,Cosmology", "license": "MIT license", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "21cmFAST", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/21cmFAST/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/21cmFAST/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "https://github.com/21cmFAST/21cmFAST"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/21cmFAST/3.0.0.dev2/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": "", "summary": "A semi-numerical cosmological simulation code for the 21cm signal", "version": "3.0.0.dev2"}, "last_serial": 6690346, "releases": {"3.0.0.dev0": [{"comment_text": "", "digests": {"md5": "ac32e0933940b102500adcb31d3821b4", "sha256": "6e09cdae319fecc03a63c80a697c7e7a391282ee061cb058559f3066a7f411fb"}, "downloads": -1, "filename": "21cmFAST-3.0.0.dev0.tar.gz", "has_sig": false, "md5_digest": "ac32e0933940b102500adcb31d3821b4", "packagetype": "sdist", "python_version": "source", "requires_python": null, "size": 403902, "upload_time": "2019-09-19T22:38:25", "upload_time_iso_8601": "2019-09-19T22:38:25.124584Z", "url": "https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/a6/c3/d9e689c04d140ba9dea3ef23de736770584aac9b31fc20682fc53a262f2f/21cmFAST-3.0.0.dev0.tar.gz"}], "3.0.0.dev1": [{"comment_text": "", "digests": {"md5": "77620c9a75255be895ce02aca83daccd", "sha256": "80fe3a98b0637f757040fb235fd15b1f0c83b7348ecee3605b54c3b6a49143c0"}, "downloads": -1, "filename": "21cmFAST-3.0.0.dev1.tar.gz", "has_sig": false, "md5_digest": "77620c9a75255be895ce02aca83daccd", "packagetype": "sdist", "python_version": "source", "requires_python": null, "size": 1873662, "upload_time": "2020-01-30T22:22:35", "upload_time_iso_8601": "2020-01-30T22:22:35.255388Z", "url": "https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/f9/31/10a3c1367690fe5ac93c838d910f37b52d336239bd7def0a3caab51630c3/21cmFAST-3.0.0.dev1.tar.gz"}], "3.0.0.dev2": [{"comment_text": "", "digests": {"md5": "c46d25051f2e55980aa5074daddd2f9c", "sha256": "f9cf52d482e3fbd3c9c91a7b9eb578f74fbaf0ac469260984346b5dbe6c57f92"}, "downloads": -1, "filename": "21cmFAST-3.0.0.dev2.tar.gz", "has_sig": false, "md5_digest": "c46d25051f2e55980aa5074daddd2f9c", "packagetype": "sdist", "python_version": "source", "requires_python": null, "size": 2815225, "upload_time": "2020-02-24T18:46:39", "upload_time_iso_8601": "2020-02-24T18:46:39.893951Z", "url": "https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/46/48/718df716f62e9291d5684c41ebe509881abf20442318edf45b3f247c0f89/21cmFAST-3.0.0.dev2.tar.gz"}]}, "urls": [{"comment_text": "", "digests": {"md5": "c46d25051f2e55980aa5074daddd2f9c", "sha256": "f9cf52d482e3fbd3c9c91a7b9eb578f74fbaf0ac469260984346b5dbe6c57f92"}, "downloads": -1, "filename": "21cmFAST-3.0.0.dev2.tar.gz", "has_sig": false, "md5_digest": "c46d25051f2e55980aa5074daddd2f9c", "packagetype": "sdist", "python_version": "source", "requires_python": null, "size": 2815225, "upload_time": "2020-02-24T18:46:39", "upload_time_iso_8601": "2020-02-24T18:46:39.893951Z", "url": "https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/46/48/718df716f62e9291d5684c41ebe509881abf20442318edf45b3f247c0f89/21cmFAST-3.0.0.dev2.tar.gz"}]}
