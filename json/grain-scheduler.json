Submit jobs / \n    # start other subtasks inside the subtask.\n    wg.start_subtask(vfn, *args, **kwargs)\n\n# Waitgroup blocks here until all of its jobs are done,\n# so outside a waitgroup is essentially sequencial.\n\nresults = wg.results # sorted in the order of submission\n\n\n# Execute one job sequentially\nresult = await grain.exec1(resource, fn, *args, **kwargs)\n```\n\nEntrypoint:\n\n```python\nasync def main(): # top-level subtask\n    # Submit jobs / start subtasks here\ngrain.run_combine(main, [worker1_addr, worker2_addr, ...], resource_per_worker)\n# ... Or for top-level parallelism, ...\n#grain.run_combine([main1, main2, ...], ...)\n```\n\nCheck out [example](example) for complete demos / more patterns and configuration sample.\n\n### Resource-awareness\n\nEvery job in the job queue has a resource request infomation along with the job to run. Before the executor run each job, it queries each worker for resource availability. If resource is insufficient, the job queue is suspended until completed jobs return resources. Resources can be CPU cores, virtual memory, both, (or anything user defined following interface `grain.resource.Resource`).\n\nEvery time a job function runs, it has access to `grain.GVAR.res`, a [context-local variable](https://trio.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference-core.html#task-local-storage) giving the information of specific resource dedicated to the job. (e.g. if a job is submitted with `CPU(3)`, asking for 3 cores, it might receive allocation like `CPU([6,7,9])`.)\n\n### Executor, Workers and communication\n\nThe top-level APIs (i.e. \"combine\") are built upon an [executor](https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html#concurrent.futures.Executor)-like backend called `grain.GrainExecutor`. It schedules and dispatches jobs to workers, and it maintains a single job queue and a result queue. The executor usually runs on the head node in a cluster.\n\nWorkers, one per node, simply receive async functions (i.e. jobs) from the executor and run them. Executor and workers use socket for communication, and [`dill`](https://dill.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) serializes the functions to byte payloads.\n\n### Acknowledgement\n\nThe API of Grain is largely insipred by [structured concurrency](https://vorpus.org/blog/notes-on-structured-concurrency-or-go-statement-considered-harmful), a major design principle behind [Trio](https://trio.readthedocs.io), and it is specifically inspired by the API of Trio. And of course, Grain uses Trio internally.\n\n### Caveat\n\nRelative import (import not on Python package path) should be within the job function. Global reference fails in this case.\n\n\n", "description_content_type": "text/markdown", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.iu.edu/zhanghar/grain", "keywords": "", "license": "", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "grain-scheduler", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/grain-scheduler/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/grain-scheduler/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "https://github.iu.edu/zhanghar/grain"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/grain-scheduler/0.11.0/", "requires_dist": ["trio", "dill", "toml", "click", "psutil"], "requires_python": ">=3.6", "summary": "A scheduler for resource-aware parallel computing on clusters.", "version": "0.11.0"}, "last_serial": 6930100, "releases": {"0.11.0": [{"comment_text": "", "digests": {"md5": "851618663e53369912f33d2f513e7fb9", "sha256": "9eeb45e29bcd322378121431ffefb67f42d5ae2ff882b344735d2ea3ce6659f8"}, "downloads": -1, "filename": "grain_scheduler-0.11.0-py3-none-any.whl", "has_sig": false, "md5_digest": "851618663e53369912f33d2f513e7fb9", "packagetype": "bdist_wheel", "python_version": "py3", "requires_python": ">=3.6", "size": 25917, "upload_time": "2020-04-01T19:05:19", "upload_time_iso_8601": "2020-04-01T19:05:19.804165Z", "url": "https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/76/1a/cc309b3f46561028e4fc7433d95b08469b431bcf2160d6071a2804f5fbd1/grain_scheduler-0.11.0-py3-none-any.whl"}, {"comment_text": "", "digests": {"md5": "879832f1a2e0bf9ed6ee076708677f3d", "sha256": "3b19af8f40a824c0f38cd3bac187a60bb16acbee009a211dc461d49b9a69ec87"}, "downloads": -1, "filename": "grain-scheduler-0.11.0.tar.gz", "has_sig": false, "md5_digest": "879832f1a2e0bf9ed6ee076708677f3d", "packagetype": "sdist", "python_version": "source", "requires_python": ">=3.6", "size": 21476, "upload_time": "2020-04-01T19:05:21", "upload_time_iso_8601": "2020-04-01T19:05:21.688072Z", "url": "https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/5c/82/bd6d7d46a6c31324d3e61f0e66d521b9f33b8a82e7fcd611147c30a05b05/grain-scheduler-0.11.0.tar.gz"}]}, "urls": [{"comment_text": "", "digests": {"md5": "851618663e53369912f33d2f513e7fb9", "sha256": "9eeb45e29bcd322378121431ffefb67f42d5ae2ff882b344735d2ea3ce6659f8"}, "downloads": -1, "filename": "grain_scheduler-0.11.0-py3-none-any.whl", "has_sig": false, "md5_digest": "851618663e53369912f33d2f513e7fb9", "packagetype": "bdist_wheel", "python_version": "py3", "requires_python": ">=3.6", "size": 25917, "upload_time": "2020-04-01T19:05:19", "upload_time_iso_8601": "2020-04-01T19:05:19.804165Z", "url": "https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/76/1a/cc309b3f46561028e4fc7433d95b08469b431bcf2160d6071a2804f5fbd1/grain_scheduler-0.11.0-py3-none-any.whl"}, {"comment_text": "", "digests": {"md5": "879832f1a2e0bf9ed6ee076708677f3d", "sha256": "3b19af8f40a824c0f38cd3bac187a60bb16acbee009a211dc461d49b9a69ec87"}, "downloads": -1, "filename": "grain-scheduler-0.11.0.tar.gz", "has_sig": false, "md5_digest": "879832f1a2e0bf9ed6ee076708677f3d", "packagetype": "sdist", "python_version": "source", "requires_python": ">=3.6", "size": 21476, "upload_time": "2020-04-01T19:05:21", "upload_time_iso_8601": "2020-04-01T19:05:21.688072Z", "url": "https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/5c/82/bd6d7d46a6c31324d3e61f0e66d521b9f33b8a82e7fcd611147c30a05b05/grain-scheduler-0.11.0.tar.gz"}]}
