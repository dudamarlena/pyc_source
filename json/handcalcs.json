Therefore its best to setup your system to make it easy to put new scripts\ninto your Python path.\n\n1. Create a \"calcs\" folder you where you will begin building your calculation library. This can be anywhere on your system you like and can have any name.\n2. Copy the absolute path of your folder and paste it into a blank text file. Save that file as a `.pth` file and save it in your Python `site-packages` directory. You can find your `site-packages` directory by typing `python -m site` in your command line. Note: This requires `python` to be in your system's PATH variable. (i.e. you have to be able to launch Python by typing `python` in a terminal).\n3. In your new \"calcs\" folder, create a blank text file and name it `__init__.py`. Within that file, insert the following:\n\n```python\n\nfrom os.path import dirname, basename, isfile\nimport glob\nmodules = glob.glob(dirname(__file__)+\"/*.py\")\n__all__ = [ basename(f)[:-3] for f in modules if isfile(f) and not f.endswith('__init__.py')]\nfrom . import *\n```\n\nThis will allow you to create subfolders in your \"calc\" folder so you can organize your calculation scripts more conveniently. For every folder you create with its own subfolders, include a copy of the same `__init__.py` file in the folder.\n\n## Basic usage\n\nThe most basic use is just to import the library:\n\n```python\n>>> import handcalcs as hand\n>>> bending_resistance = hand.Calc(\"calcs.wood.timber.mr\") # Loads calcs/wood/timber/mr.py, my pre-written script\n>>> bending_resistance.inputs # Remind yourself what the function parameters are for your script\n<Signature (b, d, f_b, K_Zb, K_L, K_D, K_H, K_Sb, K_T, phi=0.9)>\n\n>>> results = bending_resistance(300, 1200, 19.2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1) # Calc object is now a callable function based on your script\n>>> results # The Calc object returns a dict with all of the intermediate values of your script included\n{'b': 300, 'd': 1200, 'f_b': 19.2, 'K_Zb': 1, 'K_L': 1, 'K_D': 1, 'K_H': 1, 'K_Sb': 1, 'K_T': 1, 'phi': 0.9, 'F_b': 19.2, 'S': 72000000.0, 'M_r': 1244160000.0}\n\n>>> bending_resistance.print(filename = \"Bending Resistance Results\")\n\"handcalcs: Latex rendering complete.\"\n\n>>> print(bending_resistance._source)\ndef main(b, d, f_b, K_Zb, K_L, K_D, K_H, K_Sb, K_T, phi = 0.9):\n    # Cl. 6.5.4.1 General Bending Moment Resistance\n\n    ## Specified strength in bending\n    F_b = f_b * (K_D*K_H*K_Sb*K_T)\n\n    ## Section Modulus\n    S = (b * d**2) / 6\n\n    ## Moment resistance\n    M_r = phi * F_b * S * K_Zb * K_L\n    return locals()\n```\n\n\nThe PDF file that is created from `.print()` is created directly from the source\ncode of the script, as seen below.\n\n<img src = \"https://github.com/connorferster/handcalcs/blob/master/rendered_latex_pdf_example.png\">\n\n## API\n\n\n\n### Properties\n\n\n### Methods\n\n\n", "description_content_type": "text/markdown", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/connorferster/handcalcs", "keywords": "", "license": "GNU General Public License v3 (GPLv3)", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "handcalcs", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/handcalcs/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/handcalcs/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "https://github.com/connorferster/handcalcs"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/handcalcs/0.2.0/", "requires_dist": ["jinja2", "pyparsing"], "requires_python": ">=3.6.0", "summary": "Converts your Python calculation script into beautifully rendered Latex, similar to how you would write a calculation by hand.", "version": "0.2.0"}, "last_serial": 6947824, "releases": {"0.1.0": [{"comment_text": "", "digests": {"md5": "e45c5b638f94e4bffd4533043537d426", "sha256": "5e04c14632bf21931a7f756112ff30bf15e4ca60a0342e8abdcecf52267c81cf"}, "downloads": -1, "filename": "handcalcs-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl", "has_sig": false, "md5_digest": "e45c5b638f94e4bffd4533043537d426", "packagetype": "bdist_wheel", "python_version": "py3", "requires_python": ">=3.6.0", "size": 16286, "upload_time": "2020-03-05T04:54:48", "upload_time_iso_8601": "2020-03-05T04:54:48.471350Z", "url": "https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/10/51/5e41476f45c3a90afeb5bbc8f9d97569f43cff4045aba5a8c34bbde32b89/handcalcs-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl"}], "0.1.1": [{"comment_text": "", "digests": {"md5": "3d2da9811b8ba48c5e3ad2e128209061", "sha256": "e29ba539404db187e15fb497949a1a38c3c7ab173895812c36490bf8d5ffca42"}, "downloads": -1, "filename": "handcalcs-0.1.1-py3-none-any.whl", "has_sig": false, "md5_digest": "3d2da9811b8ba48c5e3ad2e128209061", "packagetype": "bdist_wheel", "python_version": "py3", "requires_python": ">=3.6.0", "size": 24734, "upload_time": "2020-03-15T22:27:53", "upload_time_iso_8601": "2020-03-15T22:27:53.343787Z", "url": "https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/ff/cb/a19e438579d9bcdd0d016861671f3991beb6b26c44e347c69c2367222e75/handcalcs-0.1.1-py3-none-any.whl"}], "0.1.2": [{"comment_text": "", "digests": {"md5": "2d3c17c29f8ce625b6c6d0d7bdda9b0d", "sha256": "d3e938b7b2596b6bf05041c59820e9d4c5c657eddf4c840c0cf6d6f5cc93b9e8"}, "downloads": -1, "filename": "handcalcs-0.1.2-py3-none-any.whl", "has_sig": false, "md5_digest": "2d3c17c29f8ce625b6c6d0d7bdda9b0d", "packagetype": "bdist_wheel", "python_version": "py3", "requires_python": ">=3.6.0", "size": 24757, "upload_time": "2020-03-15T22:51:40", "upload_time_iso_8601": "2020-03-15T22:51:40.842351Z", "url": "https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/e3/d2/f308d8c02c8fcd2bd265e9aa9ddb73334a4550a2ec8236975fe62b87cf18/handcalcs-0.1.2-py3-none-any.whl"}], "0.2.0": [{"comment_text": "", "digests": {"md5": "c617cec0c26529af395a8f19942dd85d", "sha256": "b1a76ff4f23994d4571b0943f7db30d3e1575db31aafca303ebe52e769519fcd"}, "downloads": -1, "filename": "handcalcs-0.2.0-py3-none-any.whl", "has_sig": false, "md5_digest": "c617cec0c26529af395a8f19942dd85d", "packagetype": "bdist_wheel", "python_version": "py3", "requires_python": ">=3.6.0", "size": 27381, "upload_time": "2020-04-04T03:22:29", "upload_time_iso_8601": "2020-04-04T03:22:29.558425Z", "url": "https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/bc/92/15b04383f62df9fab6061517c3b7761e046b3c38046f6b45fcb8c00eaa60/handcalcs-0.2.0-py3-none-any.whl"}]}, "urls": [{"comment_text": "", "digests": {"md5": "c617cec0c26529af395a8f19942dd85d", "sha256": "b1a76ff4f23994d4571b0943f7db30d3e1575db31aafca303ebe52e769519fcd"}, "downloads": -1, "filename": "handcalcs-0.2.0-py3-none-any.whl", "has_sig": false, "md5_digest": "c617cec0c26529af395a8f19942dd85d", "packagetype": "bdist_wheel", "python_version": "py3", "requires_python": ">=3.6.0", "size": 27381, "upload_time": "2020-04-04T03:22:29", "upload_time_iso_8601": "2020-04-04T03:22:29.558425Z", "url": "https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/bc/92/15b04383f62df9fab6061517c3b7761e046b3c38046f6b45fcb8c00eaa60/handcalcs-0.2.0-py3-none-any.whl"}]}
