This e.g. allows non-alliance scouts to correctly report blues and non-blues. And is allows JF pilots to, which other non-alliance characters on grid are actually blues and which are not and therefore a potential threat.\n\nHere is an high level overview of the main features:\n\n- Synchronize alliance contacts to chosen non-alliance characters\n- Synchronization is ongoing until user chooses to remove character from synchronization\n- Supports multiple alliances\n- Synchronization automatically ceases once the user is no longer eligible\n\n## Screenshot\n\nHere is a screenshot of the main screen.\n\n![Main Screen](https://i.imgur.com/xGdoqsp.png)\n\n## How it works\n\nTo enable non-alliance members to use alliance standings the personal contact of that character are replaced with the alliance contacts.\n\n## Installation\n\n### 1. Install app\n\nInstall into AA virtual environment with PIP install ffrom PyPI:\n\n```bash\npip install aa-standingssync\n```\n\n### 2 Update Eve Online app\n\nUpdate the Eve Online app used for authentication in your AA installation to include the following scopes:\n\n```plain\nesi-characters.read_contacts.v1\nesi-characters.write_contacts.v1\nesi-alliances.read_contacts.v1\n```\n\n### 3. Configure AA settings\n\nConfigure your AA settings (`local.py`) as follows:\n\n- Add `'standingssync'` to `INSTALLED_APPS`\n- Add these lines add to bottom of your settings file:\n\n   ```python\n   # settings for standingssync\n   CELERYBEAT_SCHEDULE['standingssync.run_regular_sync'] = {\n       'task': 'standingssync.tasks.run_regular_sync',\n       'schedule': crontab(minute=0, hour='*/2')\n   }\n   ```\n\n   > **Note**:<br>This configures the sync process to run every 2 hours starting at 00:00 AM UTC. Feel free to adjust the timing to the needs of you alliance.<br>However, do not schedule it too tightly. Or you risk generating more and more tasks, when sync tasks from previous runs are not able to finish within the alloted time.\n\n### 4. Finalize installation into AA\n\nRun migrations & copy static files\n\n```bash\npython manage.py migrate\npython manage.py collectstatic\n```\n\nRestart your supervisor services for AA\n\n### 5. Setup permissions\n\nNow you can access Alliance Auth and setup permissions for your users. See section \"Permissions\" below for details.\n\n### 6. Setup alliance character\n\nFinally you need to set the alliance character that will be used for fetching the alliance contacts / standing. Just click on \"Set Alliance Character\" and add the requested token. Note that only users with the appropriate permission will be able to see and use this function.\n\nOnce an alliance character is set the app will immediately start fetching alliance contacts. Wait a minute and then reload the page to see the result.\n\nThat's it. The Standing Sync app is fully installed and ready to be used.\n\n## Updating\n\nTo update your existing installation of Alliance Freight first enable your virtual environment.\n\nThen run the following commands from your AA project directory (the one that contains `manage.py`).\n\n```bash\npip install -U aa-standingssync\n```\n\n```bash\npython manage.py migrate\n```\n\n```bash\npython manage.py collectstatic\n```\n\nFinally restart your AA supervisor services.\n\n## Settings\n\nHere is a list of available settings for this app. They can be configured by adding them to your AA settings file (`local.py`). If they are not set the defaults are used.\n\nName | Description | Default\n-- | -- | --\n`STANDINGSSYNC_CHAR_MIN_STANDING`| minimum standing a character needs to have with the alliance to be able to sync | `0.1`<br>*this means it has to have some blue standing, neutrals will rejected* | No\n\n## Permissions\n\nThis app only uses two permission. One for enabling this app for users and one for enabling users to add alliances for syncing.\n\nName | Purpose | Code\n-- | -- | --\nCan add synced character |Enabling the app for a user. This permission should be enabled for everyone who is allowed to use the app (e.g. Member state) |  `add_syncedcharacter`\nCan add alliance manager |Enables adding alliances for syncing by setting the character for fetching alliance contacts. This should be limited to users with admins / leadership privileges. |  `add_syncmanager`\n\n## Admin functions\n\nAdmins will find a \"Standings Sync\" section on the admin page. This section provides the following features:\n\n- See a list of all setup alliances with their sync status\n\n- See a list of all enabled characters with their current sync status\n\n- Manually remove characters / alliances from sync\n\n- Manually start the sync process for characters / alliances\n\n## Feedback\n\nIf you encounter any bugs or would like to request a new feature please open an issue in this gitlab repo.", "description_content_type": "text/markdown", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://gitlab.com/ErikKalkoken/aa-standingssync", "keywords": "", "license": "MIT", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "aa-standingssync", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/aa-standingssync/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/aa-standingssync/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "https://gitlab.com/ErikKalkoken/aa-standingssync"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/aa-standingssync/1.0.4/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": ">=3.5", "summary": "Standing sync for non-alliance characters - plugin for for Alliance Auth", "version": "1.0.4"}, "last_serial": 7059955, "releases": {"1.0.3": [{"comment_text": "", "digests": {"md5": "5c20e12f2b729959536139cf7259c354", "sha256": "766f6b9f4c3d5742e3b055f16aef3f58c2af26295987fa8c15964151b3635859"}, "downloads": -1, "filename": "aa-standingssync-1.0.3.tar.gz", "has_sig": false, "md5_digest": "5c20e12f2b729959536139cf7259c354", "packagetype": "sdist", "python_version": "source", "requires_python": ">=3.5", "size": 101181, "upload_time": "2020-04-12T12:44:32", "upload_time_iso_8601": "2020-04-12T12:44:32.711057Z", "url": "https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/b1/c7/a0d0aec31a591afdef1762a0f44da7791be486e0cc9929935882862f5bc3/aa-standingssync-1.0.3.tar.gz"}], "1.0.3a1": [{"comment_text": "", "digests": {"md5": "3b44ad56c1f429b9b31a29ce54161755", "sha256": "c0e36273eeb95f5146cf526c8aeb703bac89e028708f6195cf8631696e6b1fcc"}, "downloads": -1, "filename": "aa-standingssync-1.0.3a1.tar.gz", "has_sig": false, "md5_digest": "3b44ad56c1f429b9b31a29ce54161755", "packagetype": "sdist", "python_version": "source", "requires_python": ">=3.5", "size": 101284, "upload_time": "2020-04-11T17:07:55", "upload_time_iso_8601": "2020-04-11T17:07:55.476894Z", "url": "https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/a0/8b/1b206e489fcc57cc14ba3be71c69ebdaaf556562968482ff1d7e30177709/aa-standingssync-1.0.3a1.tar.gz"}], "1.0.4": [{"comment_text": "", "digests": {"md5": "502bbdc93870b1bf32d69409cf721d83", "sha256": "2172b570a1d66ebb27df0794519de465e38a0b49d01d32474c552534466cb4b5"}, "downloads": -1, "filename": "aa-standingssync-1.0.4.tar.gz", "has_sig": false, "md5_digest": "502bbdc93870b1bf32d69409cf721d83", "packagetype": "sdist", "python_version": "source", "requires_python": ">=3.5", "size": 103290, "upload_time": "2020-04-20T13:13:00", "upload_time_iso_8601": "2020-04-20T13:13:00.059070Z", "url": "https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/63/45/310e065380f518ec004dc00d7d26beaebf30f5fe241a69715c07c4e666c0/aa-standingssync-1.0.4.tar.gz"}]}, "urls": [{"comment_text": "", "digests": {"md5": "502bbdc93870b1bf32d69409cf721d83", "sha256": "2172b570a1d66ebb27df0794519de465e38a0b49d01d32474c552534466cb4b5"}, "downloads": -1, "filename": "aa-standingssync-1.0.4.tar.gz", "has_sig": false, "md5_digest": "502bbdc93870b1bf32d69409cf721d83", "packagetype": "sdist", "python_version": "source", "requires_python": ">=3.5", "size": 103290, "upload_time": "2020-04-20T13:13:00", "upload_time_iso_8601": "2020-04-20T13:13:00.059070Z", "url": "https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/63/45/310e065380f518ec004dc00d7d26beaebf30f5fe241a69715c07c4e666c0/aa-standingssync-1.0.4.tar.gz"}]}
