It isn't much of a linker but a \"KerbalObject to KSM convetor\"\n\n* Only the Data and Main sections are currently supported, as I am planning to implement Function sections when I get to it with the assembler.\n\n---\n\n### Required arguments:\n\nklinker requires one argument that corresponds to the path of the input .ko file.\n\nFor example, if there was a file called `launch.ko` it would be opened using:\n\n`python3 -m klinker launch.ko`\n\nThis can be an absolute or relative path and should work on both linux and Windows, and possibly MacOS too.\n\n---\n\n### Optional arguments:\n\nklinker has the option of specifying the output file name and path.\n\nThis can be specified using `-o` / `--output`\n\nThe default output location is in the current working directory, to a file named `out.ksm`\n\nFor example, if I wanted instead the output of my KerbalObject `launch.ko` file to be named `launch.ksm` it would be done using the following:\n\n`python3 -m klinker launch.ko -o launch.ksm`\n\n---\n\nIf you have any questions / suggestions let me know.\n\nI do plan to clean up the code a little more, but I tried to write comments on every function and class to make it easier to look at. This was just enough to get a small linker in the KerbalObject format working.\n\n", "description_content_type": "text/markdown", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/etherealfryingpan/kerbal-klinker", "keywords": "", "license": "", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "kerbal-linker", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/kerbal-linker/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/kerbal-linker/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "https://github.com/etherealfryingpan/kerbal-klinker"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/kerbal-linker/0.1.0/", "requires_dist": ["kobjectlib (==0.1.1)"], "requires_python": "", "summary": "Python program for linking KerbalObject files into a runnable KSM file or shared library.", "version": "0.1.0"}, "last_serial": 7012088, "releases": {"0.1.0": [{"comment_text": "", "digests": {"md5": "0ec4d92b64412020b6da73e76736fdc2", "sha256": "6bff591deb3ce9a1f8bcd6116adcf6ab0a4a83503165f4db27bb66f03788dfb5"}, "downloads": -1, "filename": "kerbal_linker-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl", "has_sig": false, "md5_digest": "0ec4d92b64412020b6da73e76736fdc2", "packagetype": "bdist_wheel", "python_version": "py3", "requires_python": null, "size": 18311, "upload_time": "2020-04-13T19:00:20", "upload_time_iso_8601": "2020-04-13T19:00:20.568338Z", "url": "https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/6d/c7/5f287093b97b3a802357e7aaba949e8b5a47a5d77bf37379e538c0f230c8/kerbal_linker-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl"}]}, "urls": [{"comment_text": "", "digests": {"md5": "0ec4d92b64412020b6da73e76736fdc2", "sha256": "6bff591deb3ce9a1f8bcd6116adcf6ab0a4a83503165f4db27bb66f03788dfb5"}, "downloads": -1, "filename": "kerbal_linker-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl", "has_sig": false, "md5_digest": "0ec4d92b64412020b6da73e76736fdc2", "packagetype": "bdist_wheel", "python_version": "py3", "requires_python": null, "size": 18311, "upload_time": "2020-04-13T19:00:20", "upload_time_iso_8601": "2020-04-13T19:00:20.568338Z", "url": "https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/6d/c7/5f287093b97b3a802357e7aaba949e8b5a47a5d77bf37379e538c0f230c8/kerbal_linker-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl"}]}
