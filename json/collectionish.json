There is no plan to support backwards compatability\nfor python 2 or 3.5.\n\n**Checkout the docs**:\n\nIt's best to checkout the `docs`_. There you'll find detailed\ndocumentation of ``collectionish``'s features and lots of examples of\nhow to use them.\n\nWhat's is it?\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nPython is a wonderful language when it comes to extending inbuilt types\nand making things that quack. ``collectionish`` subscribes to the\nideology that the behaviour of data structures belongs *in* data\nstructures and that it's better and more graceful to bake the behavior\ninto a type than to complicate surrounding business logic creating many\nmore wtf moments and room for bugs to sneak in.\n\nPython's own `collections`_ module is a great example. take\n``defaultdict``, how many times have you seen something like this?\n\n.. code:: python\n\n\n   pets = [('cat', 'tabby'),\n           ('cat', 'ginger'),\n           ('dog', 'beagle'),\n           ('dog', 'poodle'),\n           ('lizard', 'gecko')\n          ]\n\n   pet_dict = {}\n   for typ, subtyp in pets:\n       try:\n           pet_dict[typ].append(subtyp)\n       except KeyError:\n           # now we'll need to make an comment to explain...\n           # if the key doesn't exist pet_dict we make a new\n           # list containing the pet's subtype\n           pet_dict[typ] = [subtyp]\n\n\nvs:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n\n   from collections import defaultdict\n\n   pet_dict = defaultdict(list)\n   for typ, subtyp in pets:\n       pet_dict[typ].append(subtyp)\n\n``collectionish`` adds some extra collections such like `AttyDict`_ (a\nstraightforward recursive dot access ``dict`` ) and `UniqueTuple`_ ( a\ntuple of unique items that remembers insertion order). New collections\nwill be added fairly regularly on the basis that they are generic enough\nand useful enough that i find myself repeating them in other projects.\n\nIn addition to data structures ``collectionish`` also provides some\noperations for working with data structures (from both standard python\nand ``collections``) like the recursive getters and setters\n`collectionish.ops`_.\n\nPrinciples:\n~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n**useful enough:**\n    Inspirations for data structures should come from stuff we've written or needed before at some point.\n\n**generic enough:**\n    To be extended within reason.\n\n**specific enough:**\n    To be clear about what things do. We don't aim to make *the* data structure or stand in for a pandas\n    dataframe that does everything.\n\n**intuitive enough**:\n    type hinting should generally work the same as it does with parent types, signatures should not be wildly\n    different, obvious magic methods or such as ``__iter__`` should not generally be missing from data types.\n\n**documented enough:**\n    All public structures and ops should be documented and have doctest examples so we know its correct and\n    It should be fairly obvious from somethings name what it is.\n\n**tested more than enough:**\n    we test with the excellent `hypothesis`_ library wherever possible. We do doctests to keep documentation correct.\n\n.. _docs: https://collectionish.readthedocs.io\n.. _collections: https://docs.python.org/library/collections.html\n.. _AttyDict: https://collectionish.readthedocs.io/_autosummary/collectionish.AttyDict.html\n.. _UniqueTuple: https://collectionish.readthedocs.io/_autosummary/collectionish.UniqueTuple.html\n.. _collectionish.ops: https://collectionish.readthedocs.io/en/stable/_autosummary/collectionish.ops.html#module-collectionish.ops\n.. _hypothesis: https://github.com/HypothesisWorks/hypothesis", "description_content_type": "text/x-rst", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/leaprovenzano/collectionish", "keywords": "collectionish", "license": "MIT license", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "collectionish", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/collectionish/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/collectionish/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "https://github.com/leaprovenzano/collectionish"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/collectionish/0.1.2/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": "", "summary": "Collectionish is a pure python library extending the basic collection data types and operations for working with them.", "version": "0.1.2"}, "last_serial": 6380258, "releases": {"0.1.0": [{"comment_text": "", "digests": {"md5": "e3ba2eeb44e0dc9432ec2cac49303adc", "sha256": "fd855f797b43a704f3407dca365176bc59f1534e4e9d2109e739da1c845aa8e4"}, "downloads": -1, "filename": "collectionish-0.1.0.tar.gz", "has_sig": false, "md5_digest": "e3ba2eeb44e0dc9432ec2cac49303adc", "packagetype": "sdist", "python_version": "source", "requires_python": null, "size": 10065, "upload_time": "2019-12-30T18:08:31", "upload_time_iso_8601": "2019-12-30T18:08:31.385978Z", "url": "https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/ae/3e/5e13c5f0573f6cca00bfa3bd0569d2fb06242fc9ac39437314a847499c13/collectionish-0.1.0.tar.gz"}], "0.1.1": [{"comment_text": "", "digests": {"md5": "e0552ff79d75dbdca189f2ed30ebad0c", "sha256": "3e246d1779e0f17cb3865a945589725dd0da3d126e69e6f5aebc30b3662df188"}, "downloads": -1, "filename": "collectionish-0.1.1.tar.gz", "has_sig": false, "md5_digest": "e0552ff79d75dbdca189f2ed30ebad0c", "packagetype": "sdist", "python_version": "source", "requires_python": null, "size": 10013, "upload_time": "2019-12-30T18:44:33", "upload_time_iso_8601": "2019-12-30T18:44:33.097577Z", "url": "https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/f4/a0/7e68577f11195d4a9a25b5e1f7a026226d88b7355df8c01ecb80f294b70c/collectionish-0.1.1.tar.gz"}], "0.1.2": [{"comment_text": "", "digests": {"md5": "f38a7fda0f69712a8672e66ac303c38b", "sha256": "445aa7595fbbfc288f4fc57992065bc2350543e0c902ddda157026c3e856375b"}, "downloads": -1, "filename": "collectionish-0.1.2.tar.gz", "has_sig": false, "md5_digest": "f38a7fda0f69712a8672e66ac303c38b", "packagetype": "sdist", "python_version": "source", "requires_python": null, "size": 12567, "upload_time": "2019-12-31T18:01:46", "upload_time_iso_8601": "2019-12-31T18:01:46.972855Z", "url": "https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/ee/08/b1fd04f573bf326514a1c7e9bbeab8f388ba38980d8290add5ee44db2fb5/collectionish-0.1.2.tar.gz"}]}, "urls": [{"comment_text": "", "digests": {"md5": "f38a7fda0f69712a8672e66ac303c38b", "sha256": "445aa7595fbbfc288f4fc57992065bc2350543e0c902ddda157026c3e856375b"}, "downloads": -1, "filename": "collectionish-0.1.2.tar.gz", "has_sig": false, "md5_digest": "f38a7fda0f69712a8672e66ac303c38b", "packagetype": "sdist", "python_version": "source", "requires_python": null, "size": 12567, "upload_time": "2019-12-31T18:01:46", "upload_time_iso_8601": "2019-12-31T18:01:46.972855Z", "url": "https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/ee/08/b1fd04f573bf326514a1c7e9bbeab8f388ba38980d8290add5ee44db2fb5/collectionish-0.1.2.tar.gz"}]}
