For\nexample, even if you actually have enough components to make 10 iPads 16Go AND\n42 iPads 32Go, we'll consider that you can promise only 42 iPads.\n\nRemoved features\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nPrevious versions of this module used to let programmers demand to get the\npotential quantity in an arbitrary Unit of Measure using the `context`. This\nfeature was present in the standard computations too until v8.0, but it has\nbeen dropped from the standard from v8.0 on.\n\nFor the sake of consistency the potential quantity is now always reported in\nthe product's main Unit of Measure too.\n\nRoadmap\n~~~~~~~\nPossible improvements for future versions:\n\n* Take manufacturing delays into account: we should not promise goods to\n  customers if they want them delivered earlier that we can make them\n* Compute the quantity of finished product that can be made directly on each\n  Bill of Material: this would be useful for production managers, and may make\n  the computations faster by avoiding to compute the same BoM several times\n  when several variants share the same BoM.\n* Add an option (probably as a sub-module) to consider all raw materials as\n  available if they can be bought from the suppliers in time for the\n  manufacturing.\n\nBug Tracker\n===========\n\nBugs are tracked on `GitHub Issues <https://github.com/OCA/stock-logistics-warehouse/issues>`_.\nIn case of trouble, please check there if your issue has already been reported.\nIf you spotted it first, help us smashing it by providing a detailed and welcomed\n`feedback <https://github.com/OCA/stock-logistics-warehouse/issues/new?body=module:%20stock_available_mrp%0Aversion:%2012.0%0A%0A**Steps%20to%20reproduce**%0A-%20...%0A%0A**Current%20behavior**%0A%0A**Expected%20behavior**>`_.\n\nDo not contact contributors directly about support or help with technical issues.\n\nCredits\n=======\n\nAuthors\n~~~~~~~\n\n* Num\u00e9rigraphe\n\nContributors\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n* Lo\u00efc Bellier (Num\u00e9rigraphe) <lb@numerigraphe.com>\n* Lionel Sausin (Num\u00e9rigraphe) <ls@numerigraphe.com>\n* many thanks to Graeme Gellatly for his advice and code review\n* Laurent Mignon <laurent.mignon@acsone.eu>\n* C\u00e9dric Pigeon <cedric.pigeon@acsone.eu>\n* Florian da Costa <florian.dacosta@akretion.com>\n\nMaintainers\n~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThis module is maintained by the OCA.\n\n.. image:: https://odoo-community.org/logo.png\n   :alt: Odoo Community Association\n   :target: https://odoo-community.org\n\nOCA, or the Odoo Community Association, is a nonprofit organization whose\nmission is to support the collaborative development of Odoo features and\npromote its widespread use.\n\nThis module is part of the `OCA/stock-logistics-warehouse <https://github.com/OCA/stock-logistics-warehouse/tree/12.0/stock_available_mrp>`_ project on GitHub.\n\nYou are welcome to contribute.
