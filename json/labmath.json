It includes functions associated with primality testing, integer factoring, prime counting, linear recurrences, modular square roots, generalized Pell equations, the classic arithmetical functions, continued fractions, partitions, St\u00f8rmer's theorem, smooth numbers, and Dirichlet convolution.  Integer arithmetic is used wherever feasible.\n\nFunctions\n=========\n\nWe make a few imports:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    from multiprocessing import Process, Queue as mpQueue\n    from itertools import chain, count, groupby, islice, tee, cycle, takewhile, compress, product, zip_longest\n    from fractions import Fraction\n    from random import randrange\n    from math import log, sqrt; inf = float('inf')\n    from heapq import merge\n\n    try: from gmpy2 import mpz; mpzv, inttypes = 2, (int, type(mpz(1)))\n    except ImportError: mpz, mpzv, inttypes = int, 0, (int,)\n\n    labmathversion = \"1.1.0\"\n\nThe *new* functions provided by this module are as follows.  Further details, including examples and input details, are available in docstrings and accessible via the built-in ``help`` function.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    primegen(limit=inf)\n\nGenerates primes less than the given limit (which may be infinite) lazily via a segmented sieve of Eratosthenes.  Uses O(\u221a\\ *p*) memory, where *p* is the most recently yielded prime.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    rpn(instr)\n\nEvaluates a string in reverse Polish notation.  The acceptable binary operators are ``+ - * / // % **`` and correspond directly to those same operators in Python3 source code.  The acceptable unary operators are ``! #``.  They are the factorial and primorial, respectively.  There are three aliases: ``x`` for ``*`` , ``xx`` for ``**`` , and ``p!`` for ``#``.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    iterprod(l)\n\nProduct of the elements of any iterable.  The product of an empty iterable is 1.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    listprod(l)\n\nProduct of the elements of a list.  The product of the empty list is 1.  We use a binary algorithm because this can easily generate huge numbers, and calling ``reduce(lambda x,y: x*y, a)`` in such situations is quite a bit slower due to the time-complexity of multiplication.  However, the size of the problem required to make this superior to ``iterprod()`` is quite large, so ``iterprod()`` should usually be used instead.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    polyval(f, x, m=None)\n\nEvaluates a polynomial at a particular point, optionally modulo something.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    binomial(n,k)\n\nThe binomial coefficient nCr(``n``, ``k``).\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    powerset(l)\n\nGenerates the powerset of a list, tuple, or string.  The yielded objects are always lists.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    primephi(x, a, ps, phicache={})\n\nLegendre's phi function.

The argument ``zc`` is a cache of zeta values.\n\n__ http://mathworld.wolfram.com/GramSeries.html\n__ http://mathworld.wolfram.com/RiemannPrimeCountingFunction.html\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    nthprimeapprox(n)\n\nProduces an integer that should be rather close to the ``n``\\ :sup:`th` prime by using binary splitting on Riemann's R function.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    nthprime(n)\n\nReturns the ``n``\\ :sup:`th` prime (counting 2 as #1).  This is done with some efficiency by using ``nthprimeapprox`` as an initial estimate, computing ``primepi`` of that, and then sieving to remove the error.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    gcd(a, *r)\n\nGreatest common divisor of any number of values.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    xgcd(a, b)\n\nExtended Euclidean altorithm: returns a tuple (``g``, *x*, *y*) such that ``g`` = gcd(``a``, ``b``) and ``g`` = ``a``\u00b7*x* + ``b``\u00b7*y*.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    modinv(a, m)\n\nReturns the inverse of ``a`` modulo ``m``, normalized to lie between ``0`` and ``m-1``.

If ``n`` is not a perfect power, return ``None``.\n\nIf ``r`` > 0: We check whether ``n`` is a perfect ``r``\\ :sup:`th` power; we return its ``r``\\ :sup:`th` root if it is and ``None`` if it isn't.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    ilog(x, b)\n\nGreatest integer *k* such that ``b``\\ :sup:`k` \u2264 ``x``.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    fibogen()\n\nGenerates the Fibonacci numbers, starting with 0 and 1.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    fibo(n, f={0:0, 1:1, 2:1})\n\nEfficiently extracts the ``n``\\ :sup:`th` Fibonacci number, indexed so that ``fibo(0)`` = 0 and ``fibo(1)`` = ``fibo(2)`` = 1.  The argument ``f`` is used for memoization.  We compute O(log(``n``)) earlier Fibonaccis along the way.  This is, in the big-O sense, just about as fast as possible.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    fibomod(n, m, f={0:0, 1:1, 2:1})\n\nEfficiently extracts the nth Fibonacci number modulo ``m``, indexed so that ``fibo(0)`` = 0 and ``fibo(1)`` == ``fibo(2)`` = 1.  The argument ``f`` is used for memoization.  We compute O(log(``n``)) earlier Fibonaccis along the way.  This is the asymptotically fastest algorithm.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    lucaschain(n, x0, x1, op1, op2)\n\nAlgorithm 3.6.7 from *Prime Numbers: A Computational Perspective* by Crandall & Pomerance (2\\ :sup:`nd` edition): Evaluation of a binary Lucas chain.  To quote their description:\n\n    For a sequence *x*\\ :sub:`0`, *x*\\ :sub:`1`, ... with a rule for computing *x*\\ :sub:`2j` from *x*\\ :sub:`j` and a rule for computing *x*\\ :sub:`2j+1` from *x*\\ :sub:`j` and *x*\\ :sub:`j+1`, this algorithm computes (*x*\\ :sub:`n`, *x*\\ :sub:`n+1`) for a given positive integer *n*.  We have *n* in binary as (*n*\\ :sub:`0`, *n*\\ :sub:`1`, ..., *n*\\ :sub:`b-1`) with *n*\\ :sub:`0` being the low-order bit.  We write the rules as follows: *x*\\ :sub:`2j` = op1(*x*\\ :sub:`j`) and *x*\\ :sub:`2j+1` = op2(*x*\\ :sub:`j`, *x*\\ :sub:`j+1`).\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    lucasgen(P, Q):\n\nGenerates the Lucas U- and V-sequences with parameters (``P``, ``Q``).\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    lucas(k, P, Q)\n\nEfficiently computes the ``k``\\ :sup:`th` terms in the Lucas U- and V-sequences U(``P``, ``Q``) and V(``P``, ``Q``).  More explicitly, if\n\n    U\\ :sub:`0`, U\\ :sub:`1`, V\\ :sub:`0`, V\\ :sub:`1` = 0, 1, 2, ``P``\n\nand we have the recursions\n\n    U\\ :sub:`n` = ``P`` \u00b7 U\\ :sub:`n-1` - ``Q`` \u00b7 U\\ :sub:`n-2`\n\n    V\\ :sub:`n` = ``P`` \u00b7 V\\ :sub:`n-1` - ``Q`` \u00b7 V\\ :sub:`n-2`\n\nthen we compute U\\ :sub:`k` and V\\ :sub:`k` in O(ln(``k``)) arithmetic operations.  If ``P``\\ :sup:`2` \u2260 4\u00b7``Q``, then these sequences grow exponentially, so the number of bit operations is anywhere from O(``k`` \u00b7 ln(``k``)\\ :sup:`2` \u00b7 ln(ln(``k``))) to O(``k``\\ :sup:`2`) depending on how multiplication is handled.  We recommend using MPZs when ``k`` > 100 or so.  We divide by ``P``\\ :sup:`2` - 4\u00b7``Q`` at the end, so we handle separately the case where this is zero.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    binlinrecgen(P, Q, a, b)\n\nThe general binary linear recursion.  Exactly like ``lucasgen``, except we only compute one sequence, and we supply the seeds.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    binlinrec(k, P, Q, a, b)\n\nThe general binary linear recursion.  Exactly like ``lucas``, except we compute only one sequence, and we supply the seeds.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    linrecgen(a, b, m=None)\n\nThe general homogenous linear recursion: we generate in order the sequence defined by\n\n    *x*\\ :sub:`n+1` = ``a``\\ :sub:`k` \u00b7 *x*\\ :sub:`n` + ``a``\\ :sub:`k-1` \u00b7 *x*\\ :sub:`n-1` + ... + ``a``\\ :sub:`0` \u00b7 *x*\\ :sub:`n-k`,\n\nwhere the initial values are [*x*\\ :sub:`0`, ..., *x*\\ :sub:`k`] = ``b``.  If ``m`` is supplied, then we compute the sequence modulo ``m``.  The terms of this sequence usually grow exponentially, so computing a distant term incrementally by plucking it out of this generator takes O(``n``\\ :sup:`2`) bit operations.  Extractions of distant terms should therefore be done via ``linrec``, which takes anywhere from O(``n`` \u00b7 ln(``n``)\\ :sup:`2` \u00b7 ln(ln(``n``))) to O(``n``\\ :sup:`2`) bit operations depending on how multiplication is handled.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    linrec(n, a, b, m=None)\n\nThe general homogeneous linear recursion.

Uses Adam Kalai's algorithm, which uses in the average case O(log(``n``)\\ :sup:`2`) primality tests.  When called with the default primality test, this then uses O(log(``n``)\\ :sup:`3`) arithmetic operations, which in turn results in just over O(log(``n``)\\ :sup:`4`) to O(log(``n``)\\ :sup:`5`) bit operations, depending on how multiplication is handled.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    sqrtmod_prime(a, p)\n\nFinds *x* such that *x*\\ :sup:`2` \u2261 ``a`` (mod ``p``).

The conventional notation for this in mathematical literature is \u03c3\\ :sub:`x`\\ (``n``), hence the name of this function.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    divcountsieve(stop)\n\nUses a sieve to compute the number of divisors of all whole numbers strictly less than the input.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    totient(n, k=1)\n\nJordan's totient function: the number of ``k``-tuples of positive integers all \u2264 ``n`` that form a coprime (``k``\\ +1)-tuple together with ``n``.  When ``k`` = 1, this is Euler's totient: the number of numbers less than a number that are relatively prime to that number.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    totientsieve(n)\n\nUses a sieve to compute the totients up to (and including) ``n``.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    totientsum(n)\n\nComputes ``sum(totient(n) for n in range(1, n+1))`` efficiently.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    mobius(n)\n\nThe M\u00f6bius function of ``n``: 1 if ``n`` is squarefree with an even number of prime factors, -1 if ``n`` is squarefree with an odd number of prime factors, and 0 if ``n`` has a repeated prime factor.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    mobiussieve(stop)\n\nUses a sieve to compute the M\u00f6bius function of all whole numbers strictly less than the input.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    liouville(n)\n\nThe Liouville lambda function of ``n``: the strongly multiplicative function that is -1 on the primes.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    polyroots_prime(g, p, sqfr=False)\n\nGenerates with some efficiency and without multiplicity the zeros of a polynomial modulo a prime.  Coded after algorithm 2.3.10 from *Prime Numbers: A Computational Perspective* by Crandall & Pomerance (2\\ :sup:`nd` edition), which is essentially Cantor-Zassenhaus.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    hensel(f, p, k, given=None)\n\nUses Hensel lifting to generate with some efficiency all zeros of a polynomial modulo a prime power.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    sqrtmod(a, n)\n\nComputes all square roots of ``a`` modulo ``n`` and returns them in a sorted list.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    polyrootsmod(pol, n)\n\nComputes the zeros of a polynomial modulo an integer.  We do this by factoring the modulus, solving modulo the prime power factors, and putting the results back together via the Chinese Remainder Theorem.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    PQa(P, Q, D)\n\nGenerates some sequences related to simple continued fractions of certain quadratic surds.  A helper function for ``pell``.  Let ``P``, ``Q``, and ``D`` be integers such that ``Q`` \u2260 0, ``D`` > 0 is a nonsquare, and ``P``\\ :sup:`2` \u2261 ``D`` (mod ``Q``). We yield a sequence of tuples (*B*\\ :sub:`i`, *G*\\ :sub:`i`, *P*\\ :sub:`i`, *Q*\\ :sub:`i`) where *i* is an index counting up from 0, *x* = (``P``\\ +\u221a\\ ``D``)/``Q`` = [*a*\\ :sub:`0`; *a*\\ :sub:`1`, *a*\\ :sub:`2`, ...], (*P*\\ :sub:`i`\\ +\u221a\\ ``D``))/*Q*\\ :sub:`i` is the *i*\\ :sup:`th` complete quotient of *x*, and *B*\\ :sub:`i` is the denominator of the *i*\\ :sup:`th` convergent to *x*.  For full details, see https://www.jpr2718.org/pell.pdf.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    pell(D, N)\n\nThis function solves the generalized Pell equation: we find all non-negative integers (*x*, *y*) such that *x*\\ :sup:`2` - ``D`` \u00b7 *y*\\ :sup:`2` = ``N``.  We have several cases:\n\nCase 1: ``N`` = 0.  We solve *x*\\ :sup:`2` = ``D`` \u00b7 *y*\\ :sup:`2`.  (0,0) is always a solution.\n\n    Case 1a: If ``D`` is a nonsquare, then there are no further solutions.\n\n    Case 1b: If ``D`` is a square, then there are infinitely many solutions, parametrized by (*t*\u00b7\u221a\\ ``D``, *t*).\n\nCase 2: ``N`` \u2260 0 = ``D``.  We solve *x*\\ :sup:`2` = ``N``.\n\n    Case 2a: If ``N`` is a nonsquare, then there are no solutions.\n\n    Case 2b: If ``N`` is a square, then there are infinitely many solutions, parametrized by (\u221a\\ ``N``, *t*).\n\nCase 3: ``N`` \u2260 0 > ``D``.  We solve *x*\\ :sup:`2` + \\|\\ ``D``\\| \u00b7 *y*\\ :sup:`2` = ``N``.  The number of solutions will be finite.\n\nCase 4: ``N`` \u2260 0 < ``D``.  We find lattice points on a hyperbola.\n\n    Case 4a: If ``D`` is a square, then the number of solutions will be at most finite.  This case is solved by factoring.\n\n    Case 4b: If ``D`` is a nonsquare, then we run the PQa/LMM algorithms: we produce a set of primitive solutions; if this set is empty, there are no solutions; if this set has members, an ininite set of solutions can be produced by repeatedly composing them with the fundamental solution of *x*\\ :sup:`2` - ``D`` \u00b7 *y*\\ :sup:`2` = 1.\n\nReferences:\n\n* http://www.jpr2718.org/pell.pdf\n* http://www.offtonic.com/blog/?p=12\n* http://www.offtonic.com/blog/?p=18\n\nInput: ``D``, ``N`` -- integers\n\nOutput:\n\n    A 3-tuple.\n\n    If the number of solutions is finite, it is ``(None, z, None)``, where ``z`` is the sorted list of all solutions.\n\n    If the number of solutions is infinite and the equation is degenerate, it's ``(gen, None, None)``, where ``gen`` yields all solutions.\n\n    If the number of solutions if infinite and the equation is nondegenerate, it is ``(gen, z, f)``, where ``z`` is the set of primitive solutions, represented as a sorted list, and ``f`` is the fundamental solution --- i.e., ``f`` is the primitive solution of *x*\\ :sup:`2` - ``D`` \u00b7 *y*\\ :sup:`2` = 1.\n\n    Note that we can check the infinitude of solutions by calling ``bool(pell(D,N)[0])``.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    simplepell(D, bail=inf)\n\nGenerates the positive solutions of *x*\\ :sup:`2` - ``D`` \u00b7 *y*\\ :sup:`2` = 1.  We use some optimizations specific to this case of the Pell equation that makes this more efficient than calling ``pell(D,1)[0]``.  Note that this function is not equivalent to calling ``pell(D,1)[0]``: ``pell`` is concerned with the general equation, which may or may not have trivial solutions, and as such yields all non-negative solutions, whereas this function is concerned only with the simple Pell equation, which always has an infinite family of positive solutions generated from a single primitive solution and always has the trivial solution (1,0).\n\nWe yield only those solutions with *x* \u2264 ``bail``.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    carmichael(n)\n\nThe Carmichael lambda function: the smallest positive integer *m* such that *a*\\ :sup:`m` \u2261 1 (mod ``n``) for all *a* such that gcd(*a*, ``n``) = 1.  Also called the reduced totient or least universal exponent.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    multord(b, n)\n\nComputes the multiplicative order of ``b`` modulo ``n``; i.e., finds the smallest *k* such that ``b``\\ :sup:`k` \u2261 1 (mod ``n``).\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    pythags_by_perimeter(p)\n\nGenerates all Pythagorean triples of a given perimeter by examining the perimeter's factors.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    collatz(n)\n\nGenerates the Collatz sequence initiated by ``n``.  Stops after yielding 1.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    sqrtcfrac(n)\n\nComputes the simple continued fraction for \u221a\\ ``n``.  We return the answer as ``(isqrt(n), [a,b,c,...,d])``, where ``[a,b,c,...,d]`` is the minimal reptend.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    convergents(a)\n\nGenerates the convergents of a simple continued fraction.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    contfrac_rat(n, d)\n\nReturns the simple continued fraction of the rational number ``n``/``d``.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    ngonal(x, n)\n\nReturns the ``x``\\ :sup:`th` ``n``-gonal number.  Indexing begins with 1 so that ``ngonal(1, n)`` = 1 for all applicable ``n``.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    is_ngonal(p, n)\n\nChecks whether ``p`` is an ``n``-gonal number.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    partitions(n, parts=[1])\n\nComputes with some semblance of efficiency the number of additive partitions of an integer.  The ``parts`` argument is for memoization.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    partgen(n)\n\nGenerates partitions of integers in ascending order via an iterative algorithm.  It is the fastest known algorithm as of June 2014.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    partconj(p)\n\nComputes the conjugate of a partition.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    farey(n)\n\nGenerates the Farey sequence of maximum denominator ``n``.  Includes 0/1 and 1/1.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    fareyneighbors(n, p, q)\n\nReturns the neighbors of ``p``/``q``  in the Farey sequence of maximum denominator ``n``.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    ispractical(n)\n\nTests whether ``n`` is a practical number -- i.e., whether every integer from 1 through ``n`` (inclusive) can be written as a sum of divisors of ``n``.  These are also called panarithmic numbers.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    hamming(ps, *ps2)\n\nGenerates all ``ps``-smooth numbers, where ``ps`` is a list of primes.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    arithmeticderivative(n)\n\nThe arithmetic derivative of ``n``: if ``n`` is prime, then ``n``' = 1; if -2 < ``n`` < 2, then ``n``' = 0; if ``n`` < 0, then ``n``' = -(-``n``)'; and (*ab*)' = *a*'\u00b7*b* + *b*'\u00b7*a*.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    perfectpowers()\n\nGenerates the sequence of perfect powers without multiplicity.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    sqfrgen(ps)\n\nGenerates the squarefree products of the elements of ``ps``.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    sqfrgenb(ps, b, k=0, m=1)\n\nGenerates the squarefree products of elements of ``ps``.  Does not yield anything > ``b``.  For best performance, ``ps`` should be sorted in decreasing order.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    stormer(ps, *ps2, abc=None)\n\nSt\u00f8rmer's theorem asserts that for any given set ``ps`` of prime numbers, there are only finitely many pairs of consecutive integers that are both ``ps``-smooth; the theorem also gives an effective algorithm for finding them.  We implement Lenstra's improvement to this theorem.\n\nThe ``abc`` argument indicates that we are to assume an effective abc conjecture of the form *c* < ``abc[0]`` \u00b7 rad(*a*\u00b7*b*\u00b7*c*)\\ :sup:`abc[1]`.  This enables major speedups.  If ``abc`` is ``None``, then we make no such assumptions.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    quadintroots(a, b, c)\n\nGiven integers ``a``, ``b``, and ``c``, we return in a tuple all distinct integers *x* such that ``a``\u00b7*x*\\ :sup:`2` + ``b``\u00b7*x* + ``c`` = 0.  This is primarily a helper function for ``cubicintrootsgiven`` and ``cubicintroots``.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    cubicintrootsgiven(a, b, c, d, r)\n\nGiven integers ``a``, ``b``, ``c``, ``d``, and ``r`` such that ``a``\u00b7``r``\\ :sup:`3` + ``b``\u00b7``r``\\ :sup:`2` + ``c``\u00b7``r`` + ``d`` = 0, we find the cubic's other two roots an return in a tuple all distinct integer roots (including ``r``).  This is primarily a helper function for ``cubicintroots``.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    cubicintroots(a, b, c, d)\n\nGiven integers ``a``, ``b``, ``c``, ``d``, we return in a tuple all distinct integer roots of ``a``\u00b7*x*\\ :sup:`3` + ``b``\u00b7*x*\\ :sup:`2` + ``c``\u00b7*x* + ``d``.  This is primarily a helper function for ``isprime_nm1``.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    isprime_nm1(n, fac=None)\n\nThe *n*-1 primality test: given an odd integer ``n`` > 214 and a fully-factored integer *F* such that *F* divides ``n``-1 and *F* > ``n``\\ :sup:`0.3`, we quickly determine without error whether ``n`` is prime.  If the provided (partial) factorization of ``n``-1 is insufficient, we compute the factorization ourselves.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    isprime_np1(n, fac=None)\n\nThe *n*\\ +1 primality test: given an odd integer ``n`` > 214 and a fully-factored integer *F* such that *F* divides ``n``\\ +1 and *F* > ``n``\\ :sup:`0.3`, we quickly determine without error whether ``n`` is prime.  If the provided (partial) factorization of ``n``\\ +1 is insufficient, we compute the factorization ourselves.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    mulparts(n, r=None, nfac=None)\n\nGenerates all ordered ``r``-tuples of positive integers whose product is ``n``.  If ``r`` is ``None``, then we generate all such tuples (regardless of size) that do not contain 1.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    dirconv(f, g, ffac=False, gfac=False)\n\nThis returns a function that is the Dirichlet convolution of ``f`` and ``g``.  When called with the keyword arguments at their default values, this is equivalent to the expression ``lambda n: sum(f(d) * g(n//d) for d in divisors(n))``.  If ``f`` or ``g`` needs to factor its argument, such as ``f == totient`` or ``g == mobius`` or something like that, then that lambda expression calls the factorizer a lot more than it needs to --- we're already factoring ``n``, so instead of feeding those functions the integer forms of ``n``'s factors, we can instead pass ``ffac=True`` or ``gfac=True`` when ``dirconv`` is called and we will call ``divisors_factored(n)`` instead and feed those factored divisors into ``f`` or ``g`` as appropriate.  This optimization becomes more noticeable as the factoring becomes more difficult.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    dirichletinverse(f)\n\nComputes the Dirichlet inverse of the input function ``f``.  Mathematically, functions *f* such that *f*\\ (1) = 0 have no Dirichlet inverses due to a division by zero.  This is reflected in this implementation by raising a ``ZeroDivisionError`` when attempting to evaluate ``dirichletinverse(f)(n)`` for any such ``f`` and any ``n``.  If ``f``\\ (1) is neither 1 nor -1, then ``dirichletinverse(f)`` will return ``Fraction`` objects (as imported from the ``fractions`` module).\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    dirichletroot(f, r, val1)\n\nComputes the ``r``\\ :sup:`th` Dirichlet root of the input function ``f`` whose value at 1 is ``val1``.  More precisely, let ``f`` be a function on the positive integers, let ``r`` be a positive integer, and let ``val1``\\ :sup:`r` = ``f``\\ (1).  Then we return the unique function ``g`` such that ``f`` = ``g`` * ``g`` * ... * ``g``, where ``g`` appears ``r`` times and * represents Dirichlet convolution.  The values returned will be ``Fraction`` objects (as imported from the ``fractions`` module).\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    determinant(M)\n\nComputes the determinant of a matrix via the Schur determinant identity.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    discriminant(coefs)\n\nComputes the discriminant of a polynomial.  The input list is ordered from lowest degree to highest --- i.e., ``coefs[k]`` is the coefficient of the *x*\\ :sup:`k` term.  For low-degree polynomials, explicit formulae are used; for degrees 5 and higher, we compute it by taking the determinant (using this package's determinant() function) of the Sylvester matrix of the input and its derivative.  This in turn is calculated by the Schur determinant identity.  Note that this has the effect of setting the discriminant of a linear polynomial to 1 (which is conventional) and that of a constant to 0.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    egypt_short(n, d, terms=0, minden=1)\n\nGenerates all shortest Egyptian fractions for ``n``/``d`` using at least the indicated number of terms and whose denominators are all \u2265 minden.  No algorithm is known for this problem that significantly improves upon brute force, so this can take impractically long times on even modest-seeming inputs.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    egypt_greedy(n, d)\n\nThe greedy algorithm for Egyptian fraction expansion; also called the Fibonacci-Sylvester algorithm.\n\n\nDependencies\n------------\n\nThis package imports items from ``multiprocessing``, ``itertools``, ``fractions``, ``random``, ``math``, and ``heapq``.  These are all in the Python standard library.\n\nWe attempt to import ``mpz`` from ``gmpy2``, but this is purely for efficiency: if this import fails, we simply set ``mpz = int``.\n\n\n",
