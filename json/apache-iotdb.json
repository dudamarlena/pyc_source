It provides users with services for data collection, storage and analysis. Due to its light-weight\narchitecture, high performance and rich feature set together with its deep integration with Apache Hadoop and Spark,\nApache IoTDB (incubating) can meet the requirements of massive data storage, high-speed data ingestion and complex data\nanalysis in the IoT industrial fields.\n\nApache IoTDB (incubating) was initially developed by Prof. Wang's Team of School of Software at Tsinghua University.\nNow it is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache Software Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the Incubator.\n\n# Apache IoTDB Python Client API\n\nUsing the package, you can write data to IoTDB, read data from IoTDB and maintain the schema of IoTDB.\n\n## Requirements\n\nYou have to install thrift (>=0.13) before using the package.\n\n## How to use (Example)\n\nYou can get an example of using the package to read and write data at here: [Example](https://github.com/apache/incubator-iotdb/blob/release%2F0.9.0/client-py/src/client_example.py)\n\n# DISCLAIMER\n\nApache IoTDB is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache Software Foundation (ASF).\nIncubation is required of all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that the\ninfrastructure, communications, and decision making process have stabilized in a manner consistent\nwith other successful ASF projects. While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the\ncompleteness or stability of the code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully\nendorsed by the ASF.\n\n", "description_content_type": "text/markdown", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/apache/incuabtor-iotdb", "keywords": "", "license": "Apache License, Version 2.0", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "apache-iotdb", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/apache-iotdb/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/apache-iotdb/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "https://github.com/apache/incuabtor-iotdb"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/apache-iotdb/0.9.0/", "requires_dist": ["thrift"], "requires_python": ">=3.7", "summary": "Apache IoTDB (incubating) client API", "version": "0.9.0"}, "last_serial": 6439115, "releases": {"0.9.0": [{"comment_text": "", "digests": {"md5": "53dd6a25d4b9366972d3f47fbcfe87ff", "sha256": "1feb6b731a9af26aac7a1e6fab74e85dd960562a1dca6e4c5c9d10234a570e82"}, "downloads": -1, "filename": "apache_iotdb-0.9.0-py3-none-any.whl", "has_sig": false, "md5_digest": "53dd6a25d4b9366972d3f47fbcfe87ff", "packagetype": "bdist_wheel", "python_version": "py3", "requires_python": ">=3.7", "size": 27555, "upload_time": "2019-12-08T13:24:23", "upload_time_iso_8601": "2019-12-08T13:24:23.383832Z", "url": "https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/84/aa/fa9401ccadb89ddce7c2b8a03baee9dbb9913c52b5936d0ec7968cabf056/apache_iotdb-0.9.0-py3-none-any.whl"}, {"comment_text": "", "digests": {"md5": "e529f75e583ba50f9c0c839a897d0489", "sha256": "0f7f2ea82b2bdfd974c1757dd2b93ae96754bf5aeb56c895f08f7302e76977ad"}, "downloads": -1, "filename": "apache-iotdb-0.9.0.tar.gz", "has_sig": false, "md5_digest": "e529f75e583ba50f9c0c839a897d0489", "packagetype": "sdist", "python_version": "source", "requires_python": ">=3.7", "size": 20316, "upload_time": "2019-12-08T13:24:26", "upload_time_iso_8601": "2019-12-08T13:24:26.298972Z", "url": "https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/76/14/d01b6281df00530c69bc8eae2074b9970bbe865a5e971b5cd2019e8b8250/apache-iotdb-0.9.0.tar.gz"}]}, "urls": [{"comment_text": "", "digests": {"md5": "53dd6a25d4b9366972d3f47fbcfe87ff", "sha256": "1feb6b731a9af26aac7a1e6fab74e85dd960562a1dca6e4c5c9d10234a570e82"}, "downloads": -1, "filename": "apache_iotdb-0.9.0-py3-none-any.whl", "has_sig": false, "md5_digest": "53dd6a25d4b9366972d3f47fbcfe87ff", "packagetype": "bdist_wheel", "python_version": "py3", "requires_python": ">=3.7", "size": 27555, "upload_time": "2019-12-08T13:24:23", "upload_time_iso_8601": "2019-12-08T13:24:23.383832Z", "url": "https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/84/aa/fa9401ccadb89ddce7c2b8a03baee9dbb9913c52b5936d0ec7968cabf056/apache_iotdb-0.9.0-py3-none-any.whl"}, {"comment_text": "", "digests": {"md5": "e529f75e583ba50f9c0c839a897d0489", "sha256": "0f7f2ea82b2bdfd974c1757dd2b93ae96754bf5aeb56c895f08f7302e76977ad"}, "downloads": -1, "filename": "apache-iotdb-0.9.0.tar.gz", "has_sig": false, "md5_digest": "e529f75e583ba50f9c0c839a897d0489", "packagetype": "sdist", "python_version": "source", "requires_python": ">=3.7", "size": 20316, "upload_time": "2019-12-08T13:24:26", "upload_time_iso_8601": "2019-12-08T13:24:26.298972Z", "url": "https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/76/14/d01b6281df00530c69bc8eae2074b9970bbe865a5e971b5cd2019e8b8250/apache-iotdb-0.9.0.tar.gz"}]}
