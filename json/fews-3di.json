You\nonly need to run this once::\n\n  $ python3 -m venv .\n\nA virtualenv puts its commands in the ``bin`` directory. So ``bin/pip``,\n``bin/pytest``, etc. Set up the dependencies like this::\n\n  $ bin/pip install -r requirements.txt\n\nThere will be a script you can run like this::\n\n  $ bin/run-fews-3di\n\nIt runs the `main()` function in `fews-3di/scripts.py`,\nadjust that if necessary. The script is configured in `setup.py` (see\n`entry_points`).\n\nIn order to get nicely formatted python files without having to spend manual\nwork on it, run the following command periodically::\n\n  $ bin/black fews_3di\n\nRun the tests regularly. This also checks with pyflakes, black and it reports\ncoverage. Pure luxury::\n\n  $ bin/pytest\n\nThe tests are also run automatically `on \"github actions\"\n<https://githug.com/nens/fews-3di/actions>`_ for\n\"master\" and for pull requests. So don't just make a branch, but turn it into\na pull request right away:\n\n- Prepend the title with \"[WIP]\", work in progress. That way you make clear it\n  isn't ready yet to be merged.\n\n- **Important**: it is easy to give feedback on pull requests. Little comments\n  on the individual lines, for instance. So use it to get early feedback, if\n  you think that's useful.\n\n- On your pull request page, you also automatically get the feedback from the\n  automated tests.\n\nThere's also\n`coverage reporting <https://coveralls.io/github/nens/fews-3di>`_\non coveralls.io (once it has been set up).\n\nIf you need a new dependency (like ``requests``), add it in ``setup.py`` in\n``install_requires``. Local development tools, like \"black\", can be added to the\n``requirements.txt`` directoy. In both cases, run install again to actuall\ninstall your dependency::\n\n  $ bin/pip install -r requirements.txt\n\n\nChangelog of fews-3di\n===================================================\n\n\n0.1 (2020-04-09)\n----------------\n\n- Started copying code from the old project.\n\n- Initial project structure created with cookiecutter and\n  https://github.com/nens/cookiecutter-python-template", "description_content_type": "", "docs_url": null, "download_url": "", "downloads": {"last_day": -1, "last_month": -1, "last_week": -1}, "home_page": "https://github.com/nens/fews-3di", "keywords": "", "license": "MIT", "maintainer": "", "maintainer_email": "", "name": "fews-3di", "package_url": "https://pypi.org/project/fews-3di/", "platform": "", "project_url": "https://pypi.org/project/fews-3di/", "project_urls": {"Homepage": "https://github.com/nens/fews-3di"}, "release_url": "https://pypi.org/project/fews-3di/0.1/", "requires_dist": null, "requires_python": "", "summary": "FEWS-3di coupling", "version": "0.1"}, "last_serial": 6986026, "releases": {"0.1": [{"comment_text": "", "digests": {"md5": "793430cf1ce0ebef66b2f7ab8a3c51fc", "sha256": "36d0e22b1c96e3c2a591a4400a2dc0d3a5c4aba8e388afa45a05f9eca522e242"}, "downloads": -1, "filename": "fews-3di-0.1.tar.gz", "has_sig": false, "md5_digest": "793430cf1ce0ebef66b2f7ab8a3c51fc", "packagetype": "sdist", "python_version": "source", "requires_python": null, "size": 10082, "upload_time": "2020-04-09T12:54:26", "upload_time_iso_8601": "2020-04-09T12:54:26.861960Z", "url": "https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/41/cc/91f5e7f0e4e4812333e11799059ae68a61d26dd44f34bab4021455853def/fews-3di-0.1.tar.gz"}]}, "urls": [{"comment_text": "", "digests": {"md5": "793430cf1ce0ebef66b2f7ab8a3c51fc", "sha256": "36d0e22b1c96e3c2a591a4400a2dc0d3a5c4aba8e388afa45a05f9eca522e242"}, "downloads": -1, "filename": "fews-3di-0.1.tar.gz", "has_sig": false, "md5_digest": "793430cf1ce0ebef66b2f7ab8a3c51fc", "packagetype": "sdist", "python_version": "source", "requires_python": null, "size": 10082, "upload_time": "2020-04-09T12:54:26", "upload_time_iso_8601": "2020-04-09T12:54:26.861960Z", "url": "https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/41/cc/91f5e7f0e4e4812333e11799059ae68a61d26dd44f34bab4021455853def/fews-3di-0.1.tar.gz"}]}
